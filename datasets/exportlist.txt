AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of integrating dairy and bioenergy systems on land use, net energy intensity (NEI), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A reference dairy farm system representative of Wisconsin was compared with a system that produces dairy and bioenergy products. This integrated system investigates the effects at the farm level when the cow diet and manure management practices are varied. The diets evaluated were supplemented with varying amounts of dry distillers grains with solubles and soybean meal and were balanced with different types of forages. The manure-management scenarios included manure land application, which is the most common manure disposal method in Wisconsin, and manure anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce biogas. A partial life cycle assessment from cradle to farm gate was conducted, where the system boundaries were expanded to include the production of biofuels in the analysis and the environmental burdens between milk and bioenergy products were partitioned by system expansion. Milk was considered the primary product and the functional unit, with ethanol, biodiesel, and biogas considered co-products. The production of the co-products was scaled according to milk production to meet the dietary requirements of each selected dairy ration. Results indicated that land use was 1.6 m2, NEI was 3.86 MJ, and GHG emissions were 1.02 kg of CO2-equivalents per kilogram of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) for the reference system. Within the integrated dairy and bioenergy system, diet scenarios that maximize dry distillers grains with solubles and implement AD had the largest reduction of GHG emissions and NEI, but the greatest increase in land use compared with the reference system. Average land use ranged from 1.68 to 2.01 m2/kg of FPCM; NEI ranged from -5.62 to -0.73 MJ/kg of FPCM; and GHG emissions ranged from 0.63 to 0.77 kg of CO2-equivalents/kg of FPCM. The AD contributed 65% of the NEI and 77% of the GHG emission reductions. Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Because adverse health effects experienced by swine farm workers in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) have been associated with exposure to dust and gases, efforts to reduce exposures are warranted, particularly in winter seasons when exposures increase due to decreased ventilation. Simulation of air quality and operating costs for ventilating swine CAFO, including treating and recirculating air through a farrowing room, was performed using mass and energy balance equations over a 90-day winter season. System operation required controlling heater operation to achieve room temperatures optimal to ensure animal health (20 to 22.5 °C). Five air pollution control devices, four room ventilation rates, and five recirculation patterns were examined. Inhalable dust concentrations were easily reduced using standard industrial air pollution control devices, including a cyclone, filtration, and electrostatic precipitator. Operating ventilation systems at 0.94 m3 s(-1) (2000 cfm) with 75 to 100% recirculation of treated air from cyclone, electrostatic precipitator, and shaker dust filtration system achieves adequate particle control with operating costs under $1.00 per pig produced ($0.22 to 0.54), although carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations approach 2000 ppm using in-room ventilated gas fired heaters. In no simulation were CO2 concentrations below industry recommended concentrations (1540 ppm), but alternative heating devices could reduce CO2 to acceptable concentrations. While this investigation does not represent all production swine farrowing barns, which differ in characteristics including room dimensions and swine occupancy, the simulation model and ventilation optimization methods can be applied to other production sites. This work shows that ventilation may be a cost-effective control option in the swine industry to reduce exposures.

AB  - Although French farmers smoke less on average than individuals from the general population, they suffer more from COPD. Exposure to biological and chemical air pollutants in the farm may be the cause of these higher COPD rates. This study investigates the role of bio-contaminants, including the relationship of exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and fine particulate matter (of diameter of 2.5 m [PM2.5]) objectively measured in the farm settings (dwellings and workplaces) to serum cytokines involved in COPD, in a sample of 72 farmers from 50 farms in the Auvergne region, France. Mean concentrations of VOCs were highest inside the home, while levels of PM2.5 were highest in workplaces (stables and granaries). After adjusting for confounders, high exposure to PM2.5 was significantly associated with a decreased level of serum cytokines (among others, IL13: beta: -0.94, CI: -1.5 to -0.2, P-value =0.004; IL8: beta: -0.82, CI: -1.4 to -0.2, P-value =0.005) and high exposure to VOCs according to a VOC global score with a decreased IL13 level (beta: -0.5, CI: -0.9 to -0.1, P-value =0.01). Moreover, respiratory symptoms and diseases, including COPD, were associated with a decreased level of serum cytokines significantly in the case of IL5. An alteration of immune response balance in terms of cytokine levels in relation to indoor chemical air pollution exposure may contribute to respiratory health impairment in farmers.

AB  - Life cycle assessment of various alternative management strategies in the swine industry was performed to evaluate their impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, cumulative energy use, and cumulative water use. The management strategies included the use of immunocastration (IC), production without ractopamine (NoRAC), production without antimicrobials used for either growth promotion (NoAGP) or disease prevention (NoPREV), production of entire males (boars) (EM), and use of gestation pens (PENS). A common baseline scenario representing standard management practices in the swine industry was created against which all alternative management practices were compared pairwise. The study scope was from cradle-to-farm gate with a functional unit of 1 kg live weight at the farm gate. The baseline and each alternative management scenario was simulated in Pig Production Environmental Footprint Calculator (PPEC) model by varying key variables to populate life cycle inventory inputs for SimaPro V7.3 (Pre' Consultant, the Netherlands), a life cycle assessment modeling program. Increase in GHG emissions, energy use, and water use were observed for NoAGP (1.56, 1.75, and 1.03%, respectively), NoPREV (17.32, 18.40, and 15.58%, respectively), and NoRAC (6.52, 4.87, and 7.52%, respectively) scenarios. For EM scenario, GHG emissions and energy use increased by 2.09 and 3.75%, respectively but water use decreased by 2.29%. Lower GHG emissions, energy use, and water use were observed for PENS (0.97, 1.50, and 0.97%, respectively) and IC (2.39, 2.57, and 2.96%, respectively) scenarios. These changes in the impact categories were statistically significant (P < 0.05) for all scenarios except for changes to GHG emissions for EM and changes to water consumption for PENS and NoAGP. However, the uncertainty analysis showed that the tails of distribution for baseline and alternative management scenario pair overlapped. The impact of management practices on sustainability metrics resulted from differences in pig performance parameters, manure production, feed consumption, etc. between various management practices and the baseline scenario. Due to uncertainties in input parameters, the results should be interpreted as general trends which specifically highlight trade-offs that may result from shifts in production practices. The study identified some of the hot spots in pig production and can be useful in determining best management practices to make swine production more environmentally sustainable.

AB  - This work analyzes the environmental impacts of milk production in an intensive dairy farm situated in the Northern Italy region of the Po Valley. Three manure management scenarios are compared: in Scenario 1 the animal slurry is stored in an open tank and then used as fertilizer. In scenario 2 the manure is processed in an anaerobic digestion plant and the biogas produced is combusted in an internal combustion engine to produce heat (required by the digester) and electricity (exported). Scenario 3 is similar to scenario 2 but the digestate is stored in a gas-tight tank. In scenario 1 the GHG emissions are estimated to be equal to 1.21 kg CO2 eq.kg(-1) Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) without allocation of the environmental burden to the by-product meat. With mass allocation, the GHG emissions associated to the milk are reduced to 1.18 kg CO2 eq.kg(-1) FPCM. Using an economic allocation approach the GHG emissions allocated to the milk are 1.13 kg CO2 eq.kg(-1) FPCM. In scenarios 2 and 3, without allocation, the GHG emissions are reduced respectively to 0.92 (-23.7%) and 0.77 (-36.5%) kg CO2 eq.kg(-1) FPCM. If land use change due to soybean production is accounted for, an additional emission of 0.53 kg CO2 eq. should be added, raising the GHG emissions to 1.74, 1.45 and 1.30 kg CO2 eq kg(-1) FPCM in scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Primary energy from non-renewable resources decreases by 36.2% and 40.6% in scenarios 2 and 3, respectively, with the valorization of the manure in the biogas plant. The other environmental impact mitigated is marine eutrophication that decreases by 8.1% in both scenarios 2 and 3, mostly because of the lower field emissions. There is, however, a trade-off between non-renewable energy and GHG savings and other environmental impacts: acidification (+6.1% and +5.5% in scenarios 2 and 3, respectively), particulate matter emissions (+1.4% and +0.7%) and photochemical ozone formation potential (+41.6% and +42.3%) increase with the adoption of a biogas plant. The cause of the increase is mostly emissions from the CHP engine. These impacts can be tackled by improving biogas combustion technologies to reduce methane and NOx emissions. Freshwater eutrophication slightly increases (+0.8% in both scenarios 2 and 3) because of the additional infrastructures needed. In conclusion, on-farm manure anaerobic digestion with the production of electricity is an effective technology to significantly reduce global environmental impacts of dairy farms (GHG emissions and non-renewable energy consumption), however local impacts may increase as a consequence (especially photochemical ozone formation).

AB  - Nursery rearing of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) alters behaviors but may be necessitated by maternal rejection or death, for research protocols, or for derivation of SPF colonies. The Tulane National Primate Research Center maintains a nursery-reared colony that is free from 9 pathogens as well as a mother-reared colony free from 4 pathogens, thus affording an opportunity to assess the outcomes of differential rearing. Nursery-reared macaques had continuous contact with 2 peers and an artificial surrogate (peer rearing). Focal sampling (432 h) was collected on the behavior of 32 peer-reared and 40 mother-reared subjects (age, 1 to 10 y; immature group, younger than 4 y; adult group 4 y or older). All animals were housed outdoors in like-reared social groups of 3 to 8 macaques. Contrary to expectation, no rearing effects on affiliative or agonistic social behaviors were detected. Compared with mother-reared subjects, peer-reared macaques in both age classes had elevated levels of abnormal appetitive, abnormal self-directed, and eating behaviors and lower levels of locomoting and vigilance (highly alert to activities in surrounding environment); a trend toward reduced foraging was detected. Immature but not adult peer-reared monkeys demonstrated more enrichment-directed behavior and drinking and a trend toward more anxiety-related behavior and inactivity. No new rearing effects were detected in adults that had not been detected in immature subjects. Results suggest that modern peer-rearing practices may not result in inevitable perturbations in aggressive, rank-related, sexual, and emotional behavior. However, abnormal behaviors may be lifelong issues once they appear.

AB  - The effects of the feeding system (ad libitum vs. restricted) and the restriction programs (daily vs. weekly base) were evaluated on 300 commercial crossbred rabbits housed individually from weaning (37 d) until slaughter (at 73 d and 80 d of age). During the first three weeks, restricted rabbits received from 85% to 100% of the ad libitum intake according to two feeding curves with daily (+4 g/d; D group) or weekly increments (+22 g/week on average; W group). In the restriction period, the feeding system affected CTTAD of crude protein (+2.4% in restricted compared ad libitum rabbits; P<0.01). After restriction, dry matter (P=0.10), ether extract (P=0.03) and ADF (P=0.05) CTTAD were lower in previously restricted rabbits compared to those always fed ad libitum. During the first period, feed restriction reduced daily weight gain (-7.5%; P<0.01), feed intake (-7.1%; P<0.001), empty body lipid (-12.7%; P=0.03) and energy (-5.2%; P<0.01) contents compared to ad libitum feeding. In the second period, previously restricted rabbits showed higher daily weight gain (+8.7%; P=0.02), lower feed conversion (-6.0%; P=0.03), besides higher empty body lipid (+16.0%; P<0.01) and energy (+6.6%; P<0.01) contents compared to rabbits fed ad libitum. In the whole trial, feed restriction reduced mortality (20.7% vs. 8.7%; P<0.01) and tended (P<0.10) to reduce feed intake (142 vs. 139 g/d), feed conversion (3.10 vs. 3.05) as well as N retention (53.6 g vs. 51.9 g). The restriction program had no effects during the restriction period. In the re-feeding period, rabbits submitted to the week-by-week restriction exhibited higher weight gain (P<0.01) and feed intake (P=0.02) and lower feed conversion (P=0.01) compared to those restricted on a daily base. In the whole trial, W rabbits showed higher feed consumption (P=0.04) and N excretion (P=0.05) than D rabbits. A later slaughter age increased final live weight (+8%; P<0.001) and feed conversion (+11%; P<0.001), dressing out percentages, dissectible fat, and hind leg muscle to bone ratio, empty body lipid (+13%; P=0.02) and energy contents (+4.2%; P=0.03), besides body N retention (+11%) and excretion (+32%) (P<0.001). In conclusion, regardless from the restriction program, a mild feed restriction (93% of ad libitum) during the first period improved rabbit health status and reduced environmental pollution in the fattening sector without impairing growth performance, slaughter results and carcass traits.

AB  - Bovine hair and dander are considered to be a notable risk factor for sensitization and allergic symptoms in occupationally exposed cattle farmers due to various IgE binding proteins. Farmers are suspected not only to be exposed during their work inside the stables but also inside their homes as allergens could be transferred via hair and clothes resulting in continued bovine allergen exposure in private areas. In recent years a new sensitive sandwich ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) test has been developed to measure the cow hair allergen (CHA) concentration in dust. The aim of the present study was to determine the CHA concentration in airborne and settled dust samples in stables and private rooms of dairy cattle farms with automatic milking systems (AM) and conventional milking systems (CM), also with respect to questionnaire data on farming characteristics. For this purpose different sampling techniques were applied, and results and practicability of the techniques were compared. Dust sampling was performed in the stable, computer room (only AM), changing room, living room and bedroom (mattress) of 12 dairy farms with automatic milking systems (AM group) and eight dairy farms with conventional milking systems (CM group). Altogether, 90 samples were taken by ALK filter dust collectors from all locations, while 32 samples were collected by an ion charging device (ICD) and 24 samples by an electronic dust fall collector (EDC) in computer rooms (AM) and/or changing and living rooms (not stables). The dust samples were extracted and analyzed for CHA content with a sandwich ELISA. At all investigated locations, CHA concentrations were above the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1 ng/ml dust extract. The median CHA concentrations in dust collected by ALK filters ranged from 63 to 7154 mug/g dust in AM farms and from 121 to 5627 mug/g dust in CM farms with a steep concentration gradient from stables to bedrooms. ICD sampling revealed median CHA contents of 112 mug/g airborne dust in the computer rooms of the AM farms and median CHA loads of 5.6 mug/g (AM farms) and 19.8 mug/g (CM farms) in the living rooms. Passive dust sampling by EDC was performed only at two locations in the AM group resulting in median CHA values of 116 mug/m(2) (computer room) and 55.0 mug/m(2) (changing room). Except for the stable samples the median CHA load was lower in AM farms compared to CM farms. The CHA contents of ALK filter samples were significantly correlated in most locations. Differences between the farming types were not significant. Although allergen transfer to the private area of the farmers has been found and results from several locations were correlated, differences in CHA concentrations were not significant with respect to questionnaire data such as the wearing of stable clothes in living room, free access of pets to stable and home, frequency of hair washing. All sampling techniques seem to being practicable for simple and effective CHA measurement. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite epidemiological findings showing increased air pollution related cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the knowledge of the involved molecular mechanisms remains moderate or weak. Particulate matter (PM) produces a local strong inflammatory reaction in the pulmonary environment but there is no final evidence that PM physically enters and deposits in blood vessels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their miRNA cargo might be the ideal candidate to mediate the effects of PM, since they could be potentially produced by the respiratory system, reach the systemic circulation and lead to the development of cardiovascular effects.The SPHERE ("Susceptibility to Particle Health Effects, miRNAs and Exosomes") project was granted by ERC-2011-StG 282413, to examine possible molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PM exposure in relation to health outcomes.; METHODS/DESIGN: The study population will include 2000 overweight (25<BMI<30 kg/cm2) or obese (BMI≥30 kg/cm2) subjects presenting at the Center for Obesity and Work (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy).Each subject donates blood, urine and hair samples. Extensive epidemiological and clinical data are collected. Exposure to PM is assigned to each subject using both daily PM10 concentration series from air quality monitors and pollutant levels estimated by the FARM (Flexible air Quality Regional Model) modelling system and elaborated by the Regional Environmental Protection Agency.The recruitment period started in September 2010 and will continue until 2015. At December 31, 2013 we recruited 1250 subjects, of whom 87% lived in the province of Milan.Primary study outcomes include cardiometabolic and respiratory health effects. The main molecular mechanism we are investigating focuses on EV-associated microRNAs.; DISCUSSION: SPHERE is the first large study aimed to explore EVs as a novel potential mechanism of how air pollution exposure acts in a highly susceptible population. The rigorous study design, the availability of banked biological samples and the potential to integrate epidemiological, clinical and molecular data will also furnish a powerful base for investigating different complementary molecular mechanisms. Our findings, if confirmed, could lead to the identification of potentially reversible alterations that might be considered as possible targets for new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - RATIONALE: Livestock farm emissions may not only affect respiratory health of farmers but also of neighboring residents.; OBJECTIVES: To explore associations between spatial and temporal variation in pollutant emissions from livestock farms and lung function in a general, nonfarming, rural population in the Netherlands.; METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2,308 adults (age, 20-72 yr). A pulmonary function test was performed measuring prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF). Spatial exposure was assessed as (1) number of farms within 500 m and 1,000 m of the home, (2) distance to the nearest farm, and (3) modeled annual average fine dust emissions from farms within 500 m and 1,000 m of the home address. Temporal exposure was assessed as week-average ambient particulate matter <10 mum in diameter and ammonia (NH3) concentrations before lung function measurements. Data were analyzed with generalized additive models (smoothing).; MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A negative association was found between the number of livestock farms within a 1,000-m buffer from the home address and MMEF, which was more pronounced in participants without atopy. No associations were found with other spatial exposure variables. Week-average particulate matter <10 mum in diameter and NH3 levels were negatively associated with FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and MMEF. In a two-pollutant model, only NH3 remained associated. A 25-mug/m3 increase in NH3 was associated with a 2.22% lower FEV1 (95% confidence interval, -3.69 to -0.74), FEV1/FVC of -1.12% (-1.96 to -0.28), and MMEF of -5.67% (-8.80 to -2.55).; CONCLUSIONS: Spatial and temporal variation in livestock air pollution emissions are associated with lung function deficits in nonfarming residents.

AB  - The greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of European grasslands (EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland), including CO2 , CH4 and N2 O, is estimated using the new process-based biogeochemical model ORCHIDEE-GM over the period 1961-2010. The model includes the following: (1) a mechanistic representation of the spatial distribution of management practice; (2) management intensity, going from intensively to extensively managed; (3) gridded simulation of the carbon balance at ecosystem and farm scale; and (4) gridded simulation of N2 O and CH4 emissions by fertilized grassland soils and livestock. The external drivers of the model are changing animal numbers, nitrogen fertilization and deposition, land-use change, and variable CO2 and climate. The carbon balance of European grassland (NBP) is estimated to be a net sink of 15±7gCm(-2) year(-1) during 1961-2010, equivalent to a 50-year continental cumulative soil carbon sequestration of 1.0±0.4PgC. At the farm scale, which includes both ecosystem CO2 fluxes and CO2 emissions from the digestion of harvested forage, the net C balance is roughly halved, down to a small sink, or nearly neutral flux of 8gCm(-2) year(-1) . Adding CH4 and N2 O emissions to net ecosystem exchange to define the ecosystem-scale GHG balance, we found that grasslands remain a net GHG sink of 19±10g C-CO2 equiv. m(-2) year(-1) , because the CO2 sink offsets N2 O and grazing animal CH4 emissions. However, when considering the farm scale, the GHG balance (NGB) becomes a net GHG source of -50gC-CO2 equiv. m(-2) year(-1) . ORCHIDEE-GM simulated an increase in European grassland NBP during the last five decades. This enhanced NBP reflects the combination of a positive trend of net primary production due to CO2 , climate and nitrogen fertilization and the diminishing requirement for grass forage due to the Europe-wide reduction in livestock numbers. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study presents the observations of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at an agricultural site from April to October 2012 in Dehui city, China. Ambient air was sampled by filter-based samplers and online PM monitors. The filter samples were analyzed to determine the abundance of ionic/inorganic elements, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). The daily PM10 concentrations varied significantly over the monitoring period, with an average of 168±63 (in the range of 52-277)mug/m(3) during the land preparation/planting period (26 April-15 June), 85±65 (36-228)mug/m(3) during the growing season (16 June-25 September), and 207±88 (103-310)mug/m(3) during the harvest period (26 September-31 October). PM2.5 accounted for 44%, 56% and 66% of atmospheric PM10 during these periods, respectively. The PM10 diurnal variation showed a distinct peak from 16:00 to 21:00 (LST) during the growing and harvesting seasons, while a gradual increase throughout the daytime until 17:00 was observed during tilling season. Mineral dust elements (Al, Ca, Fe, and Mg) dominated the PM10 chemical composition during the tilling season; OC, NO3(-), SO4(2-) and NH4(+) during the growing season; and carbonaceous species (i.e., OC and EC) during the harvesting season. Our results indicate that the soil particles emitted by farm tillage and organic matter released from straw burning are the two most significant sources of PM10 emissions contributing to the recurring high pollution events in this region. Therefore, development of agricultural PM inventories from soil tillage and straw burning is prioritized to support air quality modeling. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main purpose of this article is to summarize and illustrate the results of a literature search on the types, levels, relative concentrations, concentration spread of individual chemicals, and number of airborne compounds (mostly volatile organic compounds, VOCs) that have been found, measured, and reported both indoors and outdoors. Two broad categories of indoor environments are considered: (1) home/school, and (2) commercial spaces. Also, two categories of outdoor environments are considered: (1) non-industrial and (2) industrial (the latter represented by the vicinity of a pig farm and the vicinity of an oil refinery). The outcome is presented as a series of graphs and tables containing the following statistics: geometric mean, arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation, variance, standard error, interquartile distance, minimum value, maximum value, and number of data (data count) for the air concentration of each reported compound in a given environment. A Supplementary Table allows interested readers to match each single value included in this compilation with its corresponding original reference. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: In the last decades, large-scale swine production has led to intensive rearing systems in which air quality can be easily degraded by aerial contaminants that can pose a health risk to the pigs and farm workers. This study evaluated the effects of fogging disinfectant procedure on productive performance, ammonia and dust concentration, aerobic bacteria and fungal spores spreading in the farrowing-weaning room.; MATERIALS AND METHOD: This trial was conducted in 2 identical farrowing-weaning rooms of a piggery. In both rooms, 30 pregnant sows were lodged in individual cages. At 75 days of age, the piglets were moved to the fattening room. In the treated room, with the birth of the first suckling-pig, the fogging disinfection with diluted Virkon S was applied once a day in the experimental room per 15 minutes at 11:00. The fogging disinfectant treatment was switched between rooms at the end of the first trial period. Temperature, relative humidity, dust (TSP-RF fractions and number of particles), ammonia concentration and aerial contaminants (enterococci, Micrococcaeae and fungal spores) were monitored in both rooms.; RESULTS: Ammonia concentration reduction induced by fogging disinfection was estimated 18%, total suspended particles and the respirable fraction were significantly lower in the experimental room. Fungal spores resulted in a significant reduction by the fogging procedure, together with dust respirable fraction and fine particulate matter abatement.; CONCLUSIONS: The fogging disinfection procedure improved air quality in the piggery, thereby enhancing workers and animals health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Results from studies on residential health effects of livestock farming are inconsistent, potentially due to simple exposure proxies used (e.g., livestock density). Accuracy of these proxies compared with measured exposure concentrations is unknown.; OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess spatial variation of endotoxin in PM10 (particulate matter ≤10mum) at residential level in a livestock-dense area, compare simple livestock exposure proxies to measured endotoxin concentrations, and evaluate whether land-use regression (LUR) can be used to explain spatial variation of endotoxin.; METHODS: The study area (3,000km2) was located in Netherlands. Ambient PM10 was collected at 61 residential sites representing a variety of surrounding livestock-related characteristics. Three to four 2-wk averaged samples were collected at each site. A local reference site was used for temporal variation adjustment. Samples were analyzed for PM10 mass by weighing and for endotoxin by using the limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Three LUR models were developed, first a model based on general livestock-related GIS predictors only, followed by models that also considered species-specific predictors and farm type-specific predictors.; RESULTS: Variation in concentrations measured between sites was substantial for endotoxin and more limited for PM10 (coefficient of variation: 43%, 8%, respectively); spatial patterns differed considerably. Simple exposure proxies were associated with endotoxin concentrations although spatial variation explained was modest (R2<26%). LUR models using a combination of animal-specific livestock-related characteristics performed markedly better, with up to 64% explained spatial variation.; CONCLUSION: The considerable spatial variation of ambient endotoxin concentrations measured in a livestock-dense area can largely be explained by LUR modeling based on livestock-related characteristics. Application of endotoxin LUR models seems promising for residential exposure estimation within health studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2252.

AB  - Microbial air pollution from livestock farms has raised concerns regarding public health. Little is known about airborne livestock-related microbial levels in residential areas. We aimed to increase insights into this issue. Air measurements were performed in 2014 and 2015 at 61 residential sites in The Netherlands. Quantitative-PCR was used to assess DNA concentrations of selected bacteria (commensals: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus spp.; a zoonotic pathogen: Campylobacter jejuni) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes ( tetW, mecA) in airborne dust. Mixed models were used to explore spatial associations (temporal adjusted) with livestock-related characteristics of the surroundings. DNA from commensals and AMR genes was detectable even at sites furthest away from farms (1200 m), albeit at lower levels. Concentrations, distinctly different between sites, were strongly associated with the density of farms in the surroundings especially with poultry and pigs. C. jejuni DNA was less prevalent (42% of samples positive). Presence of C. jejuni was solely associated with poultry (OR: 4.7 (95% CI: 1.7-14), high versus low poultry density). Residential exposure to livestock-related bacteria and AMR genes was demonstrated. Identified associations suggest contribution of livestock farms to microbial air pollution in general and attribution differences between farm types. This supports the plausibility of recent studies showing health effects in relation to residential proximity to farms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Living in livestock-dense areas has been associated with health effects, suggesting airborne exposures to livestock farm emissions to be relevant for public health. Livestock farm emissions involve complex mixtures of various gases and particles. Endotoxin, a pro-inflammatory agent of microbial origin, is a constituent of livestock farm emitted particulate matter (PM) that is potentially related to the observed health effects. Quantification of livestock associated endotoxin exposure at residential addresses in relation to health outcomes has not been performed earlier.; OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess exposure-response relations for a range of respiratory endpoints and atopic sensitization in relation to livestock farm associated PM10 and endotoxin levels.; METHODS: Self-reported respiratory symptoms of 12,117 persons participating in a population-based cross-sectional study were analyzed. For 2494 persons, data on lung function (spirometry) and serologically assessed atopic sensitization was additionally available. Annual-average PM10 and endotoxin concentrations at home addresses were predicted by dispersion modelling and land-use regression (LUR) modelling. Exposure-response relations were analyzed with generalized additive models.; RESULTS: Health outcomes were generally more strongly associated with exposure to livestock farm emitted endotoxin compared to PM10. An inverse association was observed for dispersion modelled exposure with atopic sensitization (endotoxin: p = .004, PM10: p = .07) and asthma (endotoxin: p = .029, PM10: p = .022). Prevalence of respiratory symptoms decreased with increasing endotoxin concentration at the lower range, while at the higher range prevalence increased with increasing concentration (p < .05). Associations between lung function parameters with exposure to PM10 and endotoxin were not statistically significant (p > .05).; CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to livestock farm emitted particulate matter is associated with respiratory health effects and atopic sensitization in non-farming residents. Results indicate endotoxin to be a potentially plausible etiologic agent, suggesting non-infectious aspects of microbial emissions from livestock farms to be important with respect to public health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to assess air pollution spatial and temporal variability in the urban area nearby the Ciampino International Airport (Rome) and to investigate the airport-related emissions contribute.; DESIGN AND SETTING: the study domain was a 64 km2 area around the airport. Two fifteen-day monitoring campaigns (late spring, winter) were carried out. Results were evaluated using several runs outputs of an airport-related sources Lagrangian particle model and a photochemical model (the Flexible Air quality Regional Model, FARM).; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: both standard and high time resolution air pollutant concentrations measurements: CO, NO, NO2, C6H6, mass and number concentration of several PM fractions. 46 fixed points (spread over the study area) of NO2 and volatile organic compounds concentrations (fifteen days averages); deterministic models outputs.; RESULTS: standard time resolution measurements, as well as model outputs, showed the airport contribution to air pollution levels being little compared to the main source in the area (i.e. vehicular traffic). However, using high time resolution measurements, peaks of particles associated with aircraft takeoff (total number concentration and soot mass concentration), and landing (coarse mass concentration) were observed, when the site measurement was downwind to the runway.; CONCLUSIONS: the frequently observed transient spikes associated with aircraft movements could lead to a not negligible contribute to ultrafine, soot and coarse particles exposure of people living around the airport. Such contribute and its spatial and temporal variability should be investigated when assessing the airports air quality impact.

AB  - Formalin footbaths are commonly used in the dairy industry to prevent cattle hoof diseases. Although formalin is a well-documented disinfectant, it is also a carcinogen and irritant. The aim of this study was to estimate the exposure of farm workers and dairy cattle to formaldehyde from footbaths located in a milking facility and a heifer facility at a dairy farm in western New York, USA. The dairy farm included approximately 3900 dairy cattle including young stock; of these, 1670 cows were milked three times per day in a 60-stall carousel milking parlor, and approximately 800 heifers were located at the heifer facility where footbaths with formalin were in use. The formaldehyde concentration of the air was measured using a Formaldemeter htV approximately 50cm above the 3% formalin footbaths in the milking (one footbath location) and heifer (three footbath locations) facilities on three consecutive days. The measured formaldehyde concentrations varied between 0.00 and 2.28ppm, falling within the safety guidelines established by the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States. Significant differences were found in the formaldehyde concentrations at the different footbath locations in the heifer facility, potentially due to the varying levels of ventilation at each location. Changes in the ambient temperature during the 3-day sampling period did not significantly affect the concentrations. We believe that the substantial ventilation at both the heifer and milking facilities ensured that the formaldehyde concentrations did not exceed OSHA guidelines, thus permitting the safe use of formalin footbaths in this farm.

AB  - Women living on rural Kenyan smallholder dairy farms burn wood as biofuel in family cookhouses. Unventilated biofuel combustion produces harmful levels of respirable particles and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in indoor environments. Biogas digesters, which can generate high methane-content biogas from livestock manure composting were recently installed on 31 farms. The study objectives were to compare VOC exposure profiles for women cooking on farms with and without biogas digesters, and to compare seasonal variations in VOC exposures for those women cooking with biogas. Participants (n=31 biogas farms, n=31 referent farms) wore passive thermal desorption VOC sampling tubes and recorded cookhouse fuel use on time activity sheets for 7 days. Women using biogas spent significantly less time (mean=509 min/week) exposed to cookhouse wood smoke compared with the referent group (mean=1122 min/week) (P<0.01). Total VOC exposure did not differ between farm groups (P=0.14), though concentrations of trans-1,3-dichloropropene, bromoform, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene in biogas cookhouses were significantly lower than in referent cookhouses, even after Bonferroni correction. The composition of VOC species was also significantly different, reflecting the different fuel sources. Biogas digester technologies have great potential for reducing exposure to wood smoke VOCs in low-income countries.

AB  - Recycled manure solids (RMS) produced in dairy farms from fresh manure need to be sanitized before using them as bedding material. However, the impact on air quality of composting RMS remains unknown. Four RMS composting methods were tested during a 10-day aging of piles in experimental chambers: static windrow (SW), turned windrow (TW), SW following drum composting for 24 h (DC24) or SW following drum composting for 72 h (DC72). Air samples were collected using a SASS3100 Dry Air Sampler on days 0 (pilling of the RMS), 5 and 10. Bacteria (16S rRNA genes), Penicillium/Aspergillus, A fumigatus, and 11 human pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Klebsiella pneumonia) were quantified by qPCR while endotoxins and dust particles were respectively measured by LAL assays and with a DustTrakTM DRX Aerosol Monitor. On day 0, RMS produced by SW and TW yielded the lowest concentrations of airborne bacteria, while DC24 resulted in the lowest levels of Penicillium/Aspergillus and dust particles. SW method led on day 5 to the lowest concentration of bacteria and Penicillium/Aspergillus, and DC24 and DC72 to the lowest concentration of airborne dust. On day 10, SW and TW piles were associated with the lowest levels of Penicillium/Aspergillus and dust particles. A significant difference was observed between concentration of airborne bacteria, Penicillium/Aspergillus and endotoxins before and during the turnover of TW piles. None of the studied human pathogens was detected in the air samples. Results of the present study suggest that SW and TW are the most promising methods for the production of composted RMS with respect to microbial air quality. However, the experimental chambers do not accurately represent commercial dairy barns and further research on these composting methods is necessary. Finally, the study highlights that bedding material and its management may be determinant factors for air quality in dairy barns. The manuscript entitled "Production of composted recycled manure solids from a Canadian dairy farm: impact on microbial air quality in experimental conditions" is a technical paper (air pollution). The research evaluated the impact on microbial air quality of composting recycled manure solids (RMS) produced from fresh cow manure. RMS need to be composted or sanitized before using them as bedding material for animals. The impact on animal health of RMS still needs to be confirmed, while the effect on air quality and the health of dairy farmers is unknown. In the present study, microbial air quality associated with four RMS composting methods was investigated. Data revealed that two methods resulted in lower aerosolization of dust particles, endotoxins, molds and bacteria.

AB  - This chapter focused on the mental health of animals used in medical research. Most laboratory animals are kept in confinement for all or most of their lives. Their housing varies, from groups of nearly identical mice in rooms housing thousands of animals, to singly caged monkeys or pigs, to large outdoor corrals for primates or hoofstock. Many, especially the smaller species such as rats, mice, and zebrafish, may be seen only a few minutes a day by their human caregivers. Many research projects include intensive handling and restraint to administer test substances or to collect tissues and data. The laboratory can entail occasional conflict between animal welfare and human priorities. What is best for the animals might require added human labour or increased expense. For example, animals on farms, in zoos, or in laboratories may be housed in small easy-to-clean cages, prioritizing cost and efficiency over what may be truly best for the animals. In the laboratory, while finances constrain some welfare advances, the most important conflict can be between the animals welfare and the need for high-quality, reliable scientific data from the experiments. This chapter highlights the serious challenge to animal welfare in that scientists might avoid various treatments and refinements that could improve animals mental lives for fear that they will weaken the quality of their science, whether by introducing excess variability in their study populations or in other ways changing the animals bodies and behaviors and how they perform as experimental subjects.

AB  - The link between various air pollutants and hospitalization for epilepsy has come under scrutiny. We have proposed that exposure to air pollution and specifically the pervasive agricultural air pollutant and greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O), may provoke susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders. Evidence supports a role of N2O exposure in reducing epileptiform seizure activity, while withdrawal from the drug has been shown to induce seizure-like activity. Therefore, we show here that the statewide use of anthropogenic nitrogen fertilizers (the most recognized causal contributor to environmental N2O burden) is significantly negatively associated with hospitalization for epilepsy in all three pre-specified hospitalization categories, even after multiple pollutant comparison correction (p<.007), while the other identified pollutants were not consistently statistically significantly associated with hospitalization for epilepsy. We discuss potential neurological mechanisms underpinning this association between air pollutants associated with farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen fertilizers and hospitalization for epilepsy.

AB  - Min and Min (2017) conducted an epidemiological investigation that revealed further support of a link between exposure to air pollution and risk for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood. We have previously reported that exposure to the agricultural and combustion pollutant, nitrous oxide (N2O), may be a primary environmental trigger in the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders, like ADHD and autism spectrum disorders. In order to validate our prior work pointing to an association between farm use of nitrogen fertilizers and a severe ADHD phenotype, we have utilized a different statistical approach (i.e., Poisson regression methodology) including two-way fixed effects. The results reported in this correspondence indicate that for a one-log unit increase in the farm use of nitrogen fertilizers, hospitalization risk for ADHD and conduct disorders increases by a factor of 1.16 (p<0.017), which was a statistically significant increase in risk after multiple pollutant comparison correction. Exposure to PM10 and NOx in this analysis was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for ADHD and conduct disorder. We are able to validate our prior conclusions and, therefore, suggest that future analyses dedicated to improving the literature on the association between air pollution and risk of ADHD take into account environmental emissions of N2O.

AB  - It has previously been demonstrated that emissions of the agricultural pollutant, nitrous oxide (N2O), may be a confounder to the relationship between herbicide use and psychiatric impairments, including ADHD. This report attempts to extend this hypothesis by testing whether annual use of anthropogenic nitrogen-based fertilizers in U.S. agriculture (thought to be the most reliable indicator of environmental N2O emissions) is associated with per capita ethanol consumption patterns, a behavior often comorbid with ADHD. State estimates of anthropogenic nitrogen fertilizers from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) were obtained for the years between 1987 and 2006. Our dependent variable was annual per capita ethanol consumption. Ethanol consumption was categorized as beer, wine, spirits, and all alcoholic beverages. Least squares dummy variable method using two-ways fixed effects was utilized. Among states above the 50th percentile in farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen for all years (i.e., agricultural states), a one log-unit increase in farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen fertilizers is associated with a 0.13 gallon increase in total per capita ethanol consumption (p<0.0125). No statistically significant association between farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen and per capita ethanol consumption was found in states below the 50th percentile in farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen. The new findings are in agreement with both behavioral human studies demonstrating a link between N2O preference and alcohol and drug use history as well as molecular studies elucidating shared mechanisms between trace N2O antinociception and alcohol-seeking related behaviors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Latino thoroughbred workers may be at risk for developing abnormal pulmonary function related to occupational exposures.; METHODS: Eighty worker participants were recruited via community-based purposive sampling. Questionnaires and spirometry tests were administered by trained lay health promoters. Demographic and occupational factors were assessed for associations with respiratory outcomes via multivariable logistic regression.; RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of participants exhibited abnormal pulmonary function (primarily restrictive), 79% reported any respiratory symptoms, and 94% infrequently used dust masks. Shorter duration of both current horse farm employment (≤5 years) and time living in the United States (≤10 years) increased the odds of abnormal pulmonary function. Shorter time living in the United States increased the odds of upper respiratory symptoms and shorter duration of current horse farm employment increased the odds of lower respiratory symptoms.; CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal pulmonary function was high among this vulnerable worker group, suggesting the need for increased dust mask usage and further exposure assessment.

AB  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to assess the environmental load of a prospective local bioethanol (EtOH) production system in Southern Italy by using lignocellulosic Fiber sorghum (FS) feedstock. A two steps analysis was carried out considering: (i) a "cradle-to-farm gate" LCA to investigate thoroughly the FS cultivation on hilly marginal land and (ii) a "cradle-to-wheels" system boundary encompassing the environmental pressure of the whole EtOH supply-use chain. Primary data related to lignocellulosic biomass production were combined with experimental feedstock conversion processes through advanced second generation technology. The purpose was the evaluation of the environmental performance of different EtOH-gasoline mixtures in midsize passenger cars: E10 (10% of EtOH and 90% of gasoline) and E85 (85% of EtOH and 15% of gasoline). N fertilization appeared as the prevailing contributor of the crop phase. The "cradle-to-wheels" results concerning E10 passenger car disclosed that the main hotspots were represented by the input of low sulphur petrol (66%) and the linked tailpipe emissions (15%), for almost all the impact categories. Otherwise, for E85 flex-fuel vehicle, the major drivers were represented by the feedstock production (46%) and the imported electricity used in the conversion facility (18%). The FS EtOH blends entailed potential environmental benefits compared with the fossil counterpart (gasoline) for climate change, ozone and fossil depletions. Otherwise, they evidenced a worse profile in terms of acidification, eutrophication and particulate matter formation. Within the context of a the prospective territorial bio-refinery network, the comparison of the annual FS bioethanol based systems with similar EtOH scenarios from giant reed perennial crops highlighted: (i) the importance to optimize the N-management for FS feedstock cultivation and (ii) the need to increase the use of the renewable energy carriers along the industrial conversion pathway.

AB  - Background: Three Komondor dogs in a small family and 3 sporadic cases exhibited a constellation of signs that included juvenile-onset of failure-to-thrive, inappetence, vomiting and/or diarrhea, and weakness. In each we documented dyshematopoiesis, increased anion gap, methylmalonic acidemia/-uria, and serum cobalamin deficiency. Urine protein electrophoresis demonstrated excretion of cubam ligands. All clinical signs and metabolic abnormalities, except proteinuria, were reversed by regular parenteral cobalamin administration. The pattern of occurrence and findings in the disorder suggested an autosomal recessive inheritance of cobalamin malabsorption with proteinuria, a condition in humans called Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome. The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular cause of this disorder in Komondors. Results: Whole genome sequencing of two affected Komondor dogs of unknown relatedness and one parent and a clinically-normal littermate of an affected dog revealed a pathogenic single-base change in the CUBN intron 55 splice donor consensus sequence (NM_001003148.1: c.8746+1G > A) that was homozygous in affected dogs and heterozygous in the unaffected parents. Alleles of the variant co-segregated with alleles of the disease locus in the entire family and all more distantly-related sporadic cases. A population study using a simple allele-specific DNA test indicated mutant allele frequencies of 8.3 and 4.5% among North American and Hungarian Komondors, respectively. Conclusions: DNA testing can be used diagnostically in Komondors when clinical signs are suggestive of cobalamin deficiency or to inform Komondor breeders prospectively and prevent occurrence of future affected dogs. This represents the third cubilin variant causing inherited selective cobalamin malabsorption in a large animal ortholog of human Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome.

AB  - The use of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has been evaluated as analytical methodology to detect and evaluate the occupational exposure to pesticides. The developed IMS methodology was used, in positive and negative modes, to determine the presence of pesticides in air and to evaluate possible inhalation exposures of workers and users based on active sampling on Teflon membranes and direct thermal desorption IMS. The negative IMS mode was used to determine bensulfuron, clorpyrifos, diniconazole, diuron, flutolanil and imidacloprid, while the positive mode was employed to evaluate formetanate, metalaxyl, metamitrone, metribuzin, paclobutrazol and pirimicarb. The IMS measurements provided limits of detection from 8pg to 600pg. Indoor air samples, from phytosanitary plants, and outdoor samples, obtained from pesticide treatments in a local farm, were analysed providing pesticide air concentrations in the range of 0.04 to>0.25mgm-3. Occupational exposure of workers and pesticide users were evaluated and compared with values recommended by the authorities, providing useful information to improve the prevention programs in the phytosanitary field.

AB  - Cities are severely affected by air pollution. Local emissions and urban structures can produce large spatial heterogeneities. We aim to improve the estimation of NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in 6 Italian metropolitan areas, using chemical-transport and machine learning models, and to assess the effect on population exposure by using information on urban population mobility. Three years (2013-2015) of simulations were performed by the Chemical-Transport Model (CTM) FARM, at 1km resolution, fed by boundary conditions provided by national-scale simulations, local emission inventories and meteorological fields. A downscaling of daily air pollutants at higher resolution (200m) was then carried out by means of a machine learning Random-Forest (RF) model, considering CTM and spatial-temporal predictors, such as population, land-use, surface greenness and vehicular traffic, as input. RF achieved mean cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.59, 0.72, 0.76 and 0.75 for NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and O3, respectively, improving results from CTM alone. Mean concentration fields exhibited clear geographical gradients caused by climate conditions, local emission sources and photochemical processes. Time series of population weighted exposure (PWE) were estimated for two months of the year 2015 and for five cities, by combining population mobility data (derived from mobile phone traffic volumes data), and concentration levels from the RF model. PWE_RF metric better approximated the observed concentrations compared with the predictions from either CTM alone or CTM and RF combined, especially for pollutants exhibiting strong spatial gradients, such as NO2. 50% of the population was estimated to be exposed to NO2 concentrations between 12 and 38mug/m3 and PM10 between 20 and 35mug/m3. This work supports the potential of machine learning methods in predicting air pollutant levels in urban areas at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: There is substantial evidence that exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) from road traffic is associated with adverse health outcomes. Although it is often assumed to be caused by vehicle exhaust emissions such as soot, other components may also contribute to detrimental effects. The toxicity of fine PM (PM2.5; <2.5m mass median aerodynamic diameter) released from brake pads was compared to PM from other sources. Materials and methods: PM2.5 of different types of brake pads (low-metallic, semi-metallic, NAO and ECE-NAO hybrid), tires and road pavement, poultry as well as the combustion of diesel fuel and wood (modern and old-fashioned stove technologies) were collected as suspensions in water. These were subsequently aerosolized for inhalation exposures. Female BALB/cOlaHsd mice were exposed for 1.5, 3, or 6hours by nose-only inhalation up to 9mg/m3. Results: Neither cytotoxicity nor oxidative stress was observed after exposure to any of the re-aerosolized PM2.5 samples. Though, at similar PM mass concentrations the potency to induce inflammatory responses was strongly dependent on the emission source. Exposure to most examined PM2.5 sources provoked inflammation including those derived from the poultry farm, wear emissions of the NAO and ECE-NAO hybrid brake pads as well as diesel and wood combustion, as indicated by neutrophil chemoattractant, KC and MIP-2 and lung neutrophil influx. Discussion and conclusions: Our study revealed considerable variability in the toxic potency of brake wear particles. Understanding of sources that are most harmful to health can provide valuable information for risk management strategies and could help decision-makers to develop more targeted air pollution regulation.

AB  - Agricultural operations routinely expose farm workers to high levels of soil dust and other airborne particulate matter that have been linked to adverse health outcomes. The main objective of this study was to investigate exposure to agricultural dust during seeding operations of Western Australian farm workers. Twenty-one wheat-belt farms were recruited to participate in the study. Data were collected over the 6-week seeding period of April-June 2014. Each farm was visited once, and workers were asked to complete a workplace survey that asked questions related to minimizing exposure to agricultural dusts and occupational health and safety issues on their farm. Farmers were also asked to simultaneously participate in monitoring of personal exposure to inhalable or respirable dust along with real-time monitoring for particulate air pollution in their tractor cabin. Sampling was undertaken for 4hr. The results showed that, on average, Western Australian farmers were exposed to personal respirable dust concentrations above the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists recommended guideline values, with some farmers being exposed to concentrations up to seven times higher than the value for respirable dusts. In comparison, in-cabin dust concentrations were lower, although some individual tractors recorded intermittently higher levels, which might be attributed to the type of work activity or process being undertaken. Remaining in tractor cabins with closed doors and windows with properly maintained seals might minimize the infiltration of hazardous dusts and may provide some protection from dust exposures. Future research should focus on educating and providing farm owners and workers with more information on adopting work processes and procedures related to minimizing harmful exposures to agricultural dusts.

AB  - In this study, we analysed the environmental profile of the strawberry industry in Northern Italy. The analysis was conducted using two scenarios as reference systems: strawberry crops grown in unheated plastic tunnels using currently existing cultivation techniques, post-harvest management practices and consumption patterns (scenario 1) and the same strawberry cultivation chain in which some of the materials used were replaced with bio-based materials (scenario 2). In numerous studies, biodegradable polymers have been shown to be environmentally friendly, thus potentially reducing environmental impacts. These materials can be recycled into carbon dioxide and water through composting. Many materials, such as Mater-BI and PLA, are also derived from renewable resources. The methodology chosen for the environmental analysis was a life cycle assessment (LCA) based on a consequential approach developed to assess a product's overall environmental impact from the production system to its usage and disposal. In the field stage, a traditional mulching film (non-biodegradable) could be replaced with a biodegradable product. This change would result in waste production of 0 kg/ha for the bio-based product compared to 260 kg/ha of waste for polyethylene (PE). In the post-harvest stage, the issue addressed was the use and disposal of packaging materials. The innovative scenario evaluated herein pertains to the use of new packaging materials that increase the shelf life of strawberries, thereby decreasing product losses while increasing waste management efficiency at the level of a distribution platform and/or sales outlet. In the event of product deterioration or non-sale of the product, the packaging and its contents could be collected together as organic waste without any additional processes because the packaging is compostable according to EN13432. Scenario 2 would achieve reductions of 20% in the global warming potential and non-renewable energy impact categories. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - China is the world's largest country on ammonia (NH3) emission, which results in sever air pollution there. China's updated Clean Air Act has started to pay attention to NH3 reduction, but it is believed that solutions are mainly constrained by implementation of suitable technologies. Here we argued that socioeconomic barriers are the key to hinder the reduction of agricultural NH3 emission for better air quality in China. We found that small farm size is the key driving force for high NH3 emission from croplands, while little manure storage and recycle facilities and the mismatch of livestock and cropland on spatial distribution are the reasons for high NH3 emission from livestock. Overcoming these socioeconomic barriers could at least reduce half of the agricultural NH3 emission while maintaining food production in China. It not only can benefit air quality but also reduce potentials of eutrophication, groundwater contamination, soil acidification, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emission.

AB  - Estimates of heritability and genotype-by-environment (G * E) interactions for three common traits, such as harvest weight (HW), body length (BL), and condition factor (K) were estimated for harvest-size turbot in an industrial farming system (IFS) and a similar system maintained at a lower temperature (IFSLT). The only difference between the two environments was the variation in water temperature. The experimental population (69 families) was composed of 16 maternal half-sib family groups and 17 full-sib families generated by artificial mating. After 15-months of rearing, 2125 and 2925 individuals from the IFS and IFSLT environments were evaluated, respectively. The genetic analysis was based on an animal model with mean family weight at tagging as a covariate, test tank effect as a fixed effect, and an additive genetic effect plus an effect common to full-sib families as random effects using the restricted maximum likelihood method. Heritability estimates within the IFS environment were medium for HW and BL (0.340.12 and 0.340.10) but very low for K (0.0090.03). Heritability estimates within the IFSLT environment for HW, BL, and K were 0.160.05, 0.170.05, and 0.040.04, respectively. The genetic correlations between HW and BL in both environments were very high (0.99) with small standard errors. However, the genetic correlations between K and other two traits (HW and BL) were both not significant. The genetic coefficients of variations for HW in the IFS and IFSLT environments were 20.16 and 9.62, and those for BL were 6.68 and 3.70. The genetic correlations for HW and BL between environments were 0.970.15 and 0.900.12, respectively. Our results suggest weak re-ranking of genotypes and heterogeneity of additive genetic variation across environments for HW and BL. The genetic correlation (0.78) for K was near the break-even point but with a high standard error (0.77). This is the first report on G * E interactions across environments for turbot growth traits, which will be of great value to optimize a turbot selective breeding program. Statement of relevance Our paper offers guideline to select breeding strategy.

AB  - The rapid development of large-scale livestock husbandry has caused serious air pollution problems (e.g., The Tuzuoqi demonstration farm belonging to the Yili Group. The farm is located in the suburb of Hohhot City in northern China). In this study, the gases in typical areas of a large-scale dairy farm were sampled and measured for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia concentrations. Fifty-two species of VOCs were identified. The VOCs emitted from the cowshed mainly consisted of halogenated hydrocarbons (16,960g/m3), ketones (15,700g/m3), esters (9889g/m3), and sulfur compounds (3677g/m3). The VOCs from the oxidation pond were mainly composed of halogenated hydrocarbons (21,940g/m3) and ketones (3589g/m3). The VOCs from the solid-liquid separation tank comprised halogenated hydrocarbons (32,010g/m3), ketones (7169g/m3), and sulfur compounds (1003g/m3). The highest concentrations of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide were obtained from the milking parlor and solid-liquid separation tank, respectively. The ammonia concentration declined gradually due to the superposition of ammonia emitted from the cowshed and milking parlor. Analysis results of the influences of distance and meteorological factors on the dispersion of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide suggested that the dilution factors decreased with increasing distance from the emission source. Within distance ranges of 0-10 and 10-25 m, the concentration dilution factors were positively correlated with wind speed and temperature but negatively correlated with humidity and atmospheric pressure. The results of our work can provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of odorous gases in large-scale livestock farms. Implications: Gases in typical areas of a large-scale dairy farm were sampled, and a total of 52 species of VOCs were identified. The highest concentrations of ketones, sulfur compounds, and esters were obtained at the cowshed (15,700, 3677, and 9889g/m3, respectively). Within the distance ranges of 0-10 and 10-25 m, the concentration dilution factors were positively correlated with wind speed and temperature.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought speculations on possible transmission routes of thesevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of the pandemic. Air pollution has been linked to increased risks of COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in regions with poor air quality, yet no retrospective study has been reported on foodborne transmission of COVID-19. While studies have shown that low temperature could dramatically prolong the persistence on SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, frozen and refrigerated foods have been widely overlooked as potential vectors in policy frameworks and risk mitigation strategies. Food transmission evidence has been disclosed in China early July 2020 by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on frozen foods, including their packaging materials and storage environments, with two re-emergent outbreaks linked to contaminated food sources. The contamination risk is augmented by a complex farm-to-table process, which favors exposure to food workers and ambient environments. Moreover, the food cold-chain also promotes contamination because laboratory studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 remained highly stable under refrigerated, at 4°C, and freezing conditions, from - 10 to - 80°C, on fish, meat, poultry, and swine skin, during 14-21days. While data are lacking on long-term survival and infectivity under these conditions, ample evidence has been shown on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. We therefore hypothesize that contaminated cold-storage foods may present a systematic risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between countries and regions. Here, we review the evidence, risk factors, current policy and knowledge gaps, on food contamination and foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Urban rooftop agriculture is a growing enterprise in the US with the goal of providing high quality, healthy, locally grown produce for city dwellers. However, air pollution abatement and the purification of stormwater are among the ecosystem services emphasized in studies of conventional green roofs. If rooftop farms actually capture pollutants, then accumulation of heavy metals in the soil could pose a problem over time. This study reports the heavy metal concentrations in soil, atmospheric deposition, and drainage output of 8 metals from the Brooklyn Grange Navy Yard Farm, rooftop vegetable farm in New York City, USA. Drainage of Pb and Mn were 6% and 14% of atmospheric bulk deposition, respectively, meaning that the Grange could be a net sink for Pb and Mn. Although there were small scale hotspots in the soil, farm-wide averages for heavy metal concentrations never exceeded guideline levels, and relatively low concentrations of Pb and Ba in the soil suggest that rooftop soils may be less vulnerable to contamination related to traffic and construction. In comparison to the growing seasons, we found relatively high concentrations of Pb and Cr in the soil during fallow periods when the soil was bare. To reduce the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals to soil, it is important to cover the soil with mulch, and discard the used mulch and unmarketable portion of vegetables, instead of recycling them via composting for soil amendments.

AB  - Enteric infectious disease in weaner piglets, including postweaning diarrhoea (PWD), are usually treated and/or prevented with antibiotics and/or zinc oxide in the piglet feed. However extensive use of antibiotics and zinc oxide in intensive animal production is unwanted as it may promote microbial antibiotic resistance and pose environmental problems. Recently, in an experimental model of PWD, we observed that oral administration of purified porcine immunoglobulin G (ppIgG) from pooled natural pig plasma could reduce enteric infection. In the present study we were able to reproduce these results as it was observed that oral ppIgG accelerated clearance of faecal haemolytic bacteria in pigs challenged with E. coli in comparison with pigs not receiving ppIgG. This effect was observed upon feeding ppIgG for seven days postweaning suggesting that ppIgG does not have to be used prophylactically for several days preweaning. Furthermore, the effect of oral administration of ppIgG for seven days postweaning was equal to or better than that of dietary zinc oxide in reducing diarrhoea symptoms and in clearing faecal haemolytic bacteria for 14 days postweaning. These observations warrant future trials of dietary ppIgG in intensive swine production units to establish its performance as an alternative to dietary antibiotics and zinc oxide for preventing PWD.

AB  - Ammonia emissions vary greatly at a local scale, and effects (eutrophication, acidification) occur primarily close to sources. Therefore it is important that spatially distributed emission estimates are located as accurately as possible. The main source of ammonia emissions is agriculture, and therefore agricultural survey statistics are the most important input data to an ammonia emission inventory alongside per activity estimates of emission potential. In the UK, agricultural statistics are collected at farm level, but are aggregated to parish level, NUTS-3 level or regular grid resolution for distribution to users. In this study, the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), associated with such amalgamation, is investigated in the context of assessing the spatial distribution of ammonia sources for emission inventories. England was used as a test area to study the effects of the MAUP. Agricultural survey data at farm level (point data) were obtained under license and amalgamated to different areal units or zones: regular 1-km, 5-km, 10-km grids and parish level, before they were imported into the emission model. The results of using the survey data at different levels of amalgamation were assessed to estimate the effects of the MAUP on the spatial inventory. The analysis showed that the size and shape of aggregation zones applied to the farm-level agricultural statistics strongly affect the location of the emissions estimated by the model. If the zones are too small, this may result in false emission "hot spots", i.e., artificially high emission values that are in reality not confined to the zone to which they are allocated. Conversely, if the zones are too large, detail may be lost and emissions smoothed out, which may give a false impression of the spatial patterns and magnitude of emissions in those zones. The results of the study indicate that the MAUP has a significant effect on the location and local magnitude of emissions in spatial inventories where amalgamated, zonal data are used.

AB  - We previously reported that bacterial diversity in sputum samples from never-smoking women in rural China varied by lung cancer status and household air pollution (HAP) exposure type. Here, we expand on our associations between environmental exposures and respiratory tract microbiota with an additional 90 never-smoking women from Xuanwei, China. DNA from sputum samples of cases (n =45) and controls (n =45) was extracted using a multistep enzymatic and physical lysis, followed by a standardized clean up. V1-V2 regions of 16S rRNA genes were Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified. Purified amplicons were sequenced by 454 FLX Titanium pyrosequencing and high-quality sequences were evaluated for diversity and taxonomic membership. In our population of never-smokers, increased risk of lung cancer was associated with lower alpha diversity compared to higher alpha diversity (Shannon: ORhigh = 1.00 [reference], ORmedium = 3.84 [1.02-14.48], ORlow = 3.78 [1.03-13.82]; observed species: ORhigh = 1.00 [reference], ORmedium = 2.37 [0.67-8.48], ORlow = 2.01 [0.58-6.97]; Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) whole tree: ORhigh = 1.00 [reference], ORmedium = 3.04 [0.85-10.92], ORlow = 2.53 [0.72-8.96]), as well as a decreased relative abundance of Fusobacteria (ORhigh = 1.00 [reference], ORmedium = 1.24 [0.42-3.66], ORlow = 2.01 [0.63-6.44], ptrend = 0.03). Increasing alpha diversity was associated with smoky coal use compared to clean fuel use among all subjects (observed species, P = 0.001; PD whole tree, P = 0.006; Shannon, P = 0.0002), as well as cases (observed species, P = 0.02; PD whole tree, P = 0.03; Shannon, P = 0.03) and controls (observed species, P = 0.01; PD whole tree, P = 0.05; Shannon, P = 0.002). Increased diversity was also associated with presence of livestock (observed species, P = 0.02; PD whole tree, P = 0.02; Shannon, P = 0.03) in the home for cases. Our study is the first to report that decreased microbial diversity is associated with risk of lung cancer. Larger studies are necessary to elucidate the direct and indirect effects attributed to the disease-specific, HAP-specific, and animal-specific associations. Environ. Mol.

AB  - Livestock manure contributes considerably to global emissions of ammonia (NH3 ) and greenhouse gases (GHG), especially methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide (N2 O). Various measures have been developed to mitigate these emissions, but most of these focus on one specific gas and/or emission source. Here, we present a meta-analysis and integrated assessment of the effects of mitigation measures on NH3 , CH4 and (direct and indirect) N2 O emissions from the whole manure management chain. We analysed the effects of mitigation technologies on NH3 , CH4 and N2 O emissions from individual sources statistically using results of 126 published studies. Whole-chain effects on NH3 and GHG emissions were assessed through scenario analysis. Significant NH3 reduction efficiencies were observed for (i) housing via lowering the dietary crude protein (CP) content (24-65%, compared to the reference situation), for (ii) external slurry storages via acidification (83%) and covers of straw (78%) or artificial films (98%), for (iii) solid manure storages via compaction and covering (61%, compared to composting), and for (iv) manure application through band spreading (55%, compared to surface application), incorporation (70%) and injection (80%). Acidification decreased CH4 emissions from stored slurry by 87%. Significant increases in N2 O emissions were found for straw-covered slurry storages (by two orders of magnitude) and manure injection (by 26-199%). These side-effects of straw covers and slurry injection on N2 O emission were relatively small when considering the total GHG emissions from the manure chain. Lowering the CP content of feed and acidifying slurry are strategies that consistently reduce NH3 and GHG emissions in the whole chain. Other strategies may reduce emissions of a specific gas or emissions source, by which there is a risk of unwanted trade-offs in the manure management chain. Proper farm-scale combinations of mitigation measures are important to minimize impacts of livestock production on global emissions of NH3 and GHG. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Cropping system diversification can reduce the negative environmental impacts of agricultural production, including soil erosion and nutrient discharge. Less is known about how diversification affects energy use, climate change, and air quality, when considering farm operations and supply chain activities. We conducted a life cycle study using measurements from a nine-year Iowa field experiment to estimate fossil energy (FE) use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, PM2.5-related emissions, human health impacts, and other agronomic and economic metrics of contrasting crop rotation systems and herbicide regimes. Rotation systems consisted of 2-year corn-soybean, 3-year corn-soybean-oat/clover, and 4-year corn-soybean-oat/alfalfa-alfalfa systems. Each was managed with conventional and low-herbicide treatments. FE consumption was 56% and 64% lower in the 3-year and 4-year rotations than in the 2-year rotation, and GHG emissions were 54% and 64% lower. Diversification reduced combined monetized damages from GHG and PM2.5-related emissions by 42% and 57%. Herbicide treatment had no significant impact on environmental outcomes, while corn and soybean yields and whole-rotation economic returns improved significantly under diversification. Results suggest that diversification via shifting from conventional corn-soybean rotations to longer rotations with small grain and forage crops substantially reduced FE use, GHG emissions, and air quality damages, without compromising economic or agronomic performance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We evaluated associations between three a-cellular measures of the oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) and acute health effects.; METHODS: We exposed 31 volunteers for 5 h to ambient air pollution at five locations: an underground train station, two traffic sites, a farm and an urban background site. Each volunteer visited at least three sites. We conducted health measurements before exposure, 2 h after exposure and the next morning. We measured air pollution on site and characterised the OP of PM2.5 and PM10 using three a-cellular assays; dithiotreitol (OP(DTT)), electron spin resonance (OP(ESR)) and ascorbic acid depletion (OP(AA)).; RESULTS: In single-pollutant models, all measures of OP were significantly associated with increases in fractional exhaled nitric oxide and increases in interleukin-6 in nasal lavage 2 h after exposure. These OP associations remained significant after adjustment for co-pollutants when only the four outdoor sites were included, but lost significance when measurements at the underground site were included. Other health end points including lung function and vascular inflammatory and coagulation parameters in blood were not consistently associated with OP.; CONCLUSIONS: We found significant associations between three a-cellular measures of OP of PM and markers of airway and nasal inflammation. However, consistency of these effects in two-pollutant models depended on how measurements at the underground site were considered. Lung function and vascular inflammatory and coagulation parameters in blood were not consistently associated with OP. Our study, therefore, provides limited support for a role of OP in predicting acute health effects of PM in healthy young adults. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) has been proposed as a more health relevant metric than PM mass. Different assays exist for measuring OP and little is known about how the different assays compare.; AIM: To assess the OP of PM collected at different site types and to evaluate differences between locations, size fractions and correlation with PM mass and PM composition for different measurement methods for OP.; METHODS: PM2.5 and PM10 was sampled at 5 sites: an underground station, a farm, 2 traffic sites and an urban background site. Three a-cellular assays; dithiothreitol (OP(DTT)), electron spin resonance (OP(ESR)) and ascorbate depletion (OP(AA)) were used to characterize the OP of PM.; RESULTS: The highest OP was observed at the underground, where OP of PM10 was 30 (OP(DTT)) to >600 (OP(ESR)) times higher compared to the urban background when expressed as OP/m(3) and 2-40 times when expressed as OP/mug. For the outdoor sites, samples from the farm showed significantly lower OP(ESR) and OP(AA), whereas samples from the continuous traffic site showed the highest OP for all assays. Contrasts in OP between sites were generally larger than for PM mass and were lower for OP(DTT) compared to OP(ESR) and OP(AA). Furthermore, OP(DTT)/mug was significantly higher in PM2.5 compared to PM10, whereas the reverse was the case for OP(ESR). OP(ESR) and OP(AA) were highly correlated with traffic-related PM components (i.e. EC, Fe, Cu, PAHs), whereas OP(DTT) showed the highest correlation with PM mass and OC.; CONCLUSIONS: Contrasts in OP between sites, differences in size fractions and correlation with PM composition depended on the specific OP assay used, with OP(ESR) and OP(AA) showing the most similar results. This suggests that either OP(ESR) or OP(AA) and OP(DTT) can complement each other in providing information regarding the oxidative properties of PM, which can subsequently be used to study its health effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To investigate the association of individual and contextual exposures with lung function by gender in rural-dwelling Canadians.; METHODS: A cross-sectional mail survey obtained completed questionnaires on exposures from 8263 individuals; a sub-sample of 1609 individuals (762 men, 847 women) additionally participated in clinical lung function testing. The three dependent variables were forced expired volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. Independent variables included smoking, waist circumference, body mass index, indoor household exposures (secondhand smoke, dampness, mold, musty odor), occupational exposures (grain dust, pesticides, livestock, farm residence), and socioeconomic status. The primary analysis was multiple linear regression, conducted separately for each outcome. The potential modifying influence of gender was tested in multivariable models using product terms between gender and each independent variable.; RESULTS: High-risk waist circumference was related to reduced FVC and FEV1 for both genders, but the effect was more pronounced in men. Greater pack-years smoking was associated with lower lung function values. Exposure to household smoke was related to reduced FEV1, and exposure to livestock, with increased FEV1. Lower income adequacy was associated with reduced FVC and FEV1.; CONCLUSION: High-risk waist circumference was more strongly associated with reduced lung function in men than women. Longitudinal research combined with rigorous exposure assessment is needed to clarify how sex and gender interact to impact lung function in rural populations.

AB  - Two down-flow wood bark-based biofilters were evaluated for their effectiveness in treating odor, NH3 and H2S under actual swine farm conditions. The water requirement for maintaining proper media moisture contents (MC) under different ventilation rates and intervals were determined. The effect of media depth and MC on the biofilters' performance was also evaluated. The aerodynamic resistance on biofilters was studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Water requirements for biofilters were obtained in the range of 3.8-556.0 L/m(3)/d for ventilation duration of 1-24 h/d (depending on the age of the pig and environmental conditions). The highest reductions in odor, NH3 and H2S, obtained in this study at empty bed residence times (EBRT) of 1.6-3.1 s, were 73.5-76.9%, 95.2-97.9% and 95.8-100.0%, respectively. The pressure drop was 28.8-68.8 Pa for a media depth of 381 mm at an EBRT of 1.6-3.1 s and an MC of 64-65%. The pressure drop followed a secondary order polynomial line with both airflow rate and media MC (R(2) = 0.927-0.982). The results of odor, NH3 and H2S reduction efficiency and pressure drop suggest a media depth of ≥254 mm, MC ≥ 35-50% and EBRT of 2-3 s for successful operations of the wood bark-based biofilters. A high correlation was found between the measured and predicted pressured drops obtained using CFD software (R(2) = 0.921, RMSE = 0.145). Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heavy dependence on fossil fuels among rural households contributes to GHG emissions and air pollution while increasing landfill loads in Poland. This study examines benefits from the renewable energy utilization support program that subsidized household purchase and installation of thermal solar panels. This review of synergy between energy, climate, and air quality policies focuses on solar panel subsidies funded through the European Union and county governments in Mazowieckie Voivodship in Poland. County government offices, using the unpublished list of households receiving subsidies for thermal solar panel installation, mediated in the implementation of the survey and collected 123 completed questionnaires in May and June 2015. The heteroscedasticity-corrected OLS estimates two equations identifying and quantifying factors influencing the purchase price of solar panels and rural household monthly energy bill savings after installation using the gathered data. Among sociodemographic variables, increasing age was associated with an increasing price paid for the panels, but education was associated with paying a lower price for solar panels and lower self-reported energy bill savings. Panel purchase price increased if the respondent was a farmer, viewed subsidies as important, and preferred domestically manufactured panels. Location of household increased the price as compared to the reference county. Savings on monthly energy bills increased if respondent had a positive view of solar energy, expected a decrease in the bill following the purchase of panels, and heated large areas in the house. Subsidy programs have been important in increased household solar energy utilization, especially among farm households, while self-reported energy bill savings increased with positive attitudes towards renewable energy and the larger heated areas in rural residences.

AB  - Farm labor housing has been described as among the worst in the nation, oftentimes with poor and unsanitary indoor living conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between indoor environmental risk factors and respiratory health among migrant farmworker occupants (N = 352) living in employer-provided housing. A cross-sectional sample of adult Latino male farm laborers were administered a questionnaire to identify the prevalence of major respiratory symptoms. Self-reported and independent observations were made to evaluate environmental respiratory risk factors and indoor housing conditions, including but not limited to, the presence of cockroaches, rodents, pesticides, and visible signs of mold. Spirometry was performed to evaluate lung function using FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), FVC (forced vital capacity), and FEV1 /FVC ratio. Bivariate analysis was applied to evaluate associations between respiratory symptoms and selected indoor environmental risk factors. Findings for respiratory health included prevalence of wheeze (11.4%), coughing up phlegm (17.3%), tightness of chest (16.8%), and runny or stuffy nose (34.4%). Respiratory risks identified inside the dwellings included the use of pesticides or bug sprays for cockroaches (31.5%), rat or mouse poison (19.5%), visible signs of water damage in the bathroom (22.5%), and mold in the sleeping room (11.1%). Spirometry values were normal for most occupants, although statistically significant associations were found between mold and coughing up phlegm when not having a cold (P = .0262); presence of mold and asthma (P = .0084); pesticides used in the home and tightness of chest (P = .0001); and use of tobacco and coughing up phlegm (P = .0131). Although causal inference can be difficult to establish from a cross-sectional study, findings from this study represents suggestive evidence that indoor environmental risk factors may be contributory factors for respiratory health problems among this vulnerable workgroup population.

AB  - Background: The commercial pet-food industry and the market value of the pet industry have increased. Most owners are concerned about their pets' health, and prefer commercial pet foods as their regular diet. This study thus aimed to determine whether a selection of local generic-brand dry canine foods had any potential to promote chronic disease. Methods: Five local, generic-brand, dry canine foods were studied for potential mutagenicity; the effects of long-term consumption were also observed in rats. All canine foods were extracted with distilled water and absolute ethanol. The Ames test was used to detect short-term genetic damage, using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 and TA100. Simultaneously, the long-term effects were studied in an animal model by observing rats fed with these canine foods, compared with normal rat food, for a period of 15 weeks. Results: Using the water extracts, all dry canine foods studied showed considerable mutagenic effects on the tester strains. One brand affected both tester strains, whereas 3 showed positive to TA98, and one to TA100. With the absolute ethanol extract, three of the five brands had a considerable mutagenic effect on TA98, and another affected TA100. In the long-term test, all rats remained alive until the end of the experiment, exhibited no apparent signs of toxicity or serious illness, and maintained normal bodyweight and weight gain. Serum blood biochemistry and hematological parameters in canine food-fed rats showed some negative effects. Correspondingly, histopathological investigation of their liver and kidneys showed deterioration. Conclusions: Mutagenic potential and the negative potential health impacts were observed in all local-brand dry canine foods tested.

AB  - Paired electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs) and daily, inhalable button samplers (BS) were used concurrently to sample endotoxin in 10 farm homes during 7-day periods in summer and winter. Winter sampling included an optical particle counter (OPC) to measure PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 . Electrostatic dust collectors and BS filters were analyzed for endotoxin using the kinetic chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Optical particle counter particulate matter (PM) data were divided into two PM categories. In summer, geometric mean (geometric standard deviation) endotoxin concentrations were 0.82 EU/m(3) (2.7) measured with the BS and 737 EU/m(2) (1.9) measured with the EDC. Winter values were 0.52 EU/m(3) (3.1) for BS and 538 EU/m(2) (3.0) for EDCs. Seven-day endotoxin values of EDCs were highly correlated with the 7-day BS sampling averages (r=0.70; P<0.001). Analysis of variance indicated a 2.4-fold increase in EDC endotoxin concentrations for each unit increase of the ratio of PM2.5 to PM2.5-10 . There was also a significant correlation between BS and EDCs endotoxin concentrations for winter (r=0.67; P<0.05) and summer (r=0.75; P<0.05). Thus, EDCs sample comparable endotoxin concentrations to BS, making EDCs a feasible, easy to use alternative to BS for endotoxin sampling. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - The electrostatic dust collector (EDC) is a passive dust sampling device for exposure assessment of airborne endotoxin and possibly allergens. EDCs consist of a non-conducting plastic folder holding two or four electrostatic cloths of defined area. The sampling time needed to achieve detectable and reproducible loading for bioaerosols has not been systematically evaluated. Thus, in 15 Iowa farm homes EDCs were deployed for 7-, 14-, and 28-day sampling periods to determine if endotoxin and allergens could be quantified and if loading rates were uniform over time, i.e. if loads doubled from 7 to 14 days or 14 to 28 days and quadrupled from 7 to 28 days. Loadings between left and right paired EDC cloths were not significantly different and were highly correlated for endotoxin, total protein, and cat (Fel d1), dog (Can f1), and mouse (Mus m1) allergens (P < 0.001). EDCs performed especially well for endotoxin sampling with close agreement between paired samples (Pearson r = 0.96, P < 0.001). Endotoxin loading of the EDCs doubled from 7- to 14-day deployments as hypothesized although the loading rate decreased from 14 to 28 days of sampling with only a 1.38-fold increase. Allergen exposure assessment using EDCs was overall less satisfactory. Although there was reasonable agreement between paired samples, only exposures to cat, dog, and mouse allergens were reliable and these only at the longer deployment times. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Electrostatic Dust Collectors (EDCs) are in use for passive sampling of bioaerosols, but particular aspects of their performance have not yet been evaluated. This study investigated the effect of mailing EDCs on endotoxin loading and the effect of EDC deployment in front of, and away from, heated ventilation on endotoxin sampling. Endotoxin sampling efficiency of heated and unheated EDC cloths was also evaluated. Cross-country express mailing of dust-spiked EDCs yielded no significant changes in endotoxin concentrations compared to dust-only samples for both high-spiked EDCs (p = 0.30) and low-spiked EDCs (p = 0.36). EDCs were also deployed in 20 identical apartments with one EDC placed in front of the univent heater in each apartment and contemporaneous EDC placed on the built-in bookshelf in each apartment. The endotoxin concentrations were significantly different (p = 0.049) indicating that the placement of EDC does impact endotoxin sampling. Heated and unheated EDCs were deployed for 7 days in pairs in farm homes. There was a significant difference between endotoxin concentrations (p = 0.027) indicating that heating EDCs may diminish their electrostatic capabilities and impact endotoxin sampling. The last study investigated the electrostatic charge of 12 heated and 12 unheated EDC cloths. There was a significant difference in charge (p = 0.009) which suggests that heating EDC cloths may make them less effective for sampling. In conclusion, EDCs can be mailed to and from deployment sites, EDC placement in relationship to ventilation is crucial, and heating EDCs reduces their electrostatic charge which may diminish their endotoxin sampling capabilities.

AB  - Many opportunities exist to reduce enteric methane (CH4) and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of product from ruminant livestock. Research over the past century in genetics, animal health, microbiology, nutrition, and physiology has led to improvements in dairy production where intensively managed farms have GHG emissions as low as 1 kg of CO2 equivalents (CO2e)/kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM), compared with >7 kg of CO2 e/kg of ECM in extensive systems. The objectives of this review are to evaluate options that have been demonstrated to mitigate enteric CH4 emissions per unit of ECM (CH4/ECM) from dairy cattle on a quantitative basis and in a sustained manner and to integrate approaches in genetics, feeding and nutrition, physiology, and health to emphasize why herd productivity, not individual animal productivity, is important to environmental sustainability. A nutrition model based on carbohydrate digestion was used to evaluate the effect of feeding and nutrition strategies on CH4/ECM, and a meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of lipid supplementation on CH4/ECM. A second model combining herd structure dynamics and production level was used to estimate the effect of genetic and management strategies that increase milk yield and reduce culling on CH4/ECM. Some of these approaches discussed require further research, but many could be implemented now. Past efforts in CH4 mitigation have largely focused on identifying and evaluating CH4 mitigation approaches based on nutrition, feeding, and modifications of rumen function. Nutrition and feeding approaches may be able to reduce CH4/ECM by 2.5 to 15%, whereas rumen modifiers have had very little success in terms of sustained CH4 reductions without compromising milk production. More significant reductions of 15 to 30% CH4/ECM can be achieved by combinations of genetic and management approaches, including improvements in heat abatement, disease and fertility management, performance-enhancing technologies, and facility design to increase feed efficiency and life-time productivity of individual animals and herds. Many of the approaches discussed are only partially additive, and all approaches to reducing enteric CH4 emissions should consider the economic impacts on farm profitability and the relationships between enteric CH4 and other GHG.

AB  - Echinacea pallida (EPAL), a herbaceous flowering plant with immunomodulatory properties, has been chosen to determine the pre- and post-supplementary effects on the growth performances, bacterial community, blood parameters and immunity of growing rabbits. The same Grimaud does (14-week-old) from the studied in the first part of this study were randomly divided into two groups (n=50/group). The first group was fed a basal diet without supplementation (Control group, C) while the another group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 3 g EPAL/kg diet (Echinacea group, E). From the second parturition, 80 weaned kits (40 from the C does and 40 from the E does) were randomly assigned to four groups of 20 animals each and were fed a growing commercial diet supplemented with or without a 3 g EPAL/kg diet: the CC group (rabbits from the C does fed the control diet), CE group (rabbits from the C does fed the supplemented diet), EC (rabbits from the E does fed the control diet) and EE group (rabbits from the E does fed the supplemented diet). The dietary EPAL treatment did not affect the growth performance. Ten fattening rabbits from each group were selected to evaluate the bacterial community and blood parameters, while the remaining rabbits (n=10/group) were used to study phagocytosis and the humoral immune response. The variability was evaluated from hard faeces at 35, 49 and 89 days, and the caecal content at 89 days. The variability of the bacterial community of the EE group was higher than that of the other groups. The phagocytic activity was higher in the CE and EE groups than in the CC and EC ones (30.9 and 29.7 v. 21.2 and 21.8%; P<0.05), whereas no statistically significant difference was observed for the blood parameters or humoral immune response against vaccination (rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus) at 95 days old which the serum was collected at 88, 102, 109, 116 and 123 days old. In conclusion, no impact of EPAL dietary supplementation has been observed on the growth performances, bacterial community, blood parameters or humoral immune responses in growing rabbits, except for an increase in phagocytic activities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: <sup></sup>In recent years, the number of people suffering from diseases caused by fungi has been increasing. However, knowledge of the biodiversity of fungal pathogens in the work environment is still insufficient. The aim of this work was to evaluate the exposure to fungi being disseminated in the air of workplaces contaminated with organic dust of plant and animal origin.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bioaerosol samples were collected at 3 occupational settings (poultry farm, biomass burning power plant and wastewater treatment plant) using button samplers. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of fungal aerosol was conducted by employing macro- and microscopic methods. Selected strains were then studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using srodointernal transcribed spacers (ITS): ITS1-ITS2, ITS3-ITS4 and ITS1-ITS4 primer pairs.; RESULTS: Average concentrations of fungal aerosol at workplaces ranged 1.2*102-2.1*106 cfu/m<sup>3</sup>. The highest fungal concentrations were recorded in the poultry farm, while the lowest were noted at the wastewater treatment plant. <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> was a predominant component of the mycobiota in the power plant and wastewater treatment plant. Almost 100% identification agreement of this pathogen between the traditional and molecular method was noted.; CONCLUSIONS: The fungal concentrations in poultry farms exceeded the Polish proposal for the threshold limit value (5*104 cfu/m<sup>3</sup>). The results of the study demonstrate a high compatibility of <i>A. fumigatus'</i> identification using the traditional and molecular methods. Taking into account the fact, that a long term exposure to <i>A. fumigatus</i> conidia at workplaces may result in numerous health complaints, the use of proper protective equipment by workers must be a standard procedure.

WSTEP: W ostatnich latach obserwowany jest wzrost liczby osob cierpiacych na choroby wywolane przez grzyby plesniowe i drozdzopodobne. Mimo to wiedza na temat bioroznorodnosci patogenow grzybowych w srodowisku pracy jest ciagle niedostateczna. Celem pracy byla ocena narazenia na grzyby rozprzestrzeniajace sie droga powietrzna w srodowisku pracy zanieczyszczonym pylem organicznym pochodzenia roslinnego i zwierzecego.MATERIAL I METODY: Probki bioaerozolu pobrano w 3 zakladach pracy (ferma drobiu, elektrownia spalajaca biomase i oczyszczalnia sciekow) za pomoca zestawow pomiarowych zlozonych z uniwersalnych aspiratorow i pobornikow guzikowych. Ilosciowa i jakosciowa analize aerozolu grzybowego przeprowadzono metoda hodowlana, oparta na analizie makro- i mikroskopowej. Wybrane szczepy poddano analizie genetycznej za pomoca lancuchowej reakcji polimerazy (polymerase chain reaction - PCR) z uzyciem par primerow do wewnetrznych regionow niekodujacych (internal transcribed spacers - ITS): ITS1-ITS2, ITS3-ITS4 i ITS1-ITS4.WYNIKI: Srednie stezenie aerozolu grzybowego na stanowiskach pracy wynosilo 1,2*102-2,1*106 jtk/m<sup>3</sup>. Najwyzsze stezenie grzybow zaobserwowano na stanowiskach pracy na fermie drobiu, a najnizsze w oczyszczalni sciekow. Analiza jakosciowa wykazala, ze na stanowiskach pracy w elektrowni i oczyszczalni sciekow dominujacym gatunkiem w stosunku do calosci izolowanej mykobioty byl <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>. Zgodnosc wynikow identyfikacji tego patogenu uzyskanych metoda hodowlana i molekularna dotyczyla 100% badanych szczepow.WNIOSKI: Stezenie bioaerozoli zmierzone na stanowiskach pracy w fermach drobiu przekraczalo polskie propozycje wartosci dopuszczalnych dla grzybow, tj. 5*104 jtk/m<sup>3</sup>. Wykazano wysoka zgodnosc identyfikacji patogenu <i>A. fumigatus</i> przy uzyciu metody tradycyjnej (hodowlanej) i metody genetycznej. Poniewaz dlugotrwale narazenie w srodowisku pracy na konidia <i>A. fumigatus</i> moze prowadzic do wystapienia u pracownikow dolegliwosci zdrowotnych, konieczne jest stosowanie przez nich odpowiednich srodkow ochronnych.

AB  - Poultry farmers are producing eggs, meat, and feathers with increased efficiency and lower carbon footprint. Technologies to address concerns about the indoor air quality inside barns and the gaseous emissions from farms to the atmosphere continue to be among industry priorities. We have been developing and scaling up a UV air treatment that has the potential to reduce odor and other gases on the farm scale. In our recent laboratory-scale study, the use of UV-A (a less toxic ultraviolet light, a.k.a. "black light") and a special TiO2-based photocatalyst reduced concentrations of several important air pollutants (NH3, CO2, N2O, O3) without impact on H2S and CH4. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to (1) scale up the UV treatment to pilot scale, (2) evaluate the mitigation of odor and odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and (3) complete preliminary economic analyses. A pilot-scale experiment was conducted under commercial poultry barn conditions to evaluate photocatalyst coatings on surfaces subjected to UV light under field conditions. In this study, the reactor was constructed to support interchangeable wall panels and installed on a poultry farm. The effects of a photocatalyst's presence (photocatalysis and photolysis), UV intensity (LED and fluorescent), and treatment time were studied in the pilot-scale experiments inside a poultry barn. The results of the pilot-scale experiments were consistent with the laboratory-scale one: the percent reduction under photocatalysis was generally higher than photolysis. In addition, the percent reduction of target gases at a high light intensity and long treatment time was higher. The percent reduction of NH3 was 5-9%. There was no impact on H2S, CH4, and CO2 under any experimental conditions. N2O and O3 concentrations were reduced at 6-12% and 87-100% by both photolysis and photocatalysis. In addition, concentrations of several VOCs responsible for livestock odor were reduced from 26 to 62% and increased with treatment time and light intensity. The odor was reduced by 18%. Photolysis treatment reduced concentrations of N2O, VOCs, and O3, only. The initial economic analysis has shown that LEDs are more efficient than fluorescent lights. Further scale-up and research at farm scale are warranted. Copyright © 2020 Lee, Li, Koziel, Ahn, Wi, Chen, Meiirkhanuly, Banik and Jenks.

AB  - Environmental variables can have profound effects on the biological responses of research animals and the outcomes of experiments dependent on them. Some of these influences are both predictable and unpredictable in effect, many are challenging to standardize, and all are influenced by the planning and conduct of experiments and the design and operation of the vivarium. Others are not yet known. Within the immediate environment where the research animal resides, in the vivarium and in transit, the most notable of these factors are ambient temperature, relative humidity, gaseous pollutant by-products of animal metabolism and physiology, dust and particulates, barometric pressure, electromagnetic fields, and illumination. Ambient temperatures in the animal housing environment, in particular those experienced by rodents below the thermoneutral zone, may introduce degrees of stress and thermoregulatory compensative responses that may complicate or invalidate study measurements across a broad array of disciplines. Other factors may have more subtle and specific effects. It is incumbent on scientists designing and executing experiments and staff responsible for animal husbandry to be aware of, understand, measure, systematically record, control, and account for the impact of these factors on sensitive animal model systems to ensure the quality and reproducibility of scientific studies.

AB  - Monocomponent and combined insecticidal baits containing acetamiprid and fipronil are proposed to control the housefly Musca domestica at livestock facilities. The combination of active ingredients increases the insecticidal activity of formulations and simultaneously may lead to an increase in their toxicity to animals. The purpose of this work was to assess the selective toxicity of acetamiprid and fipronilas parts of mono- and bicomponent insecticides. The intestinal activity of insecticides against adult houseflies was assessed by no-choice feeding tests. The acute toxicity of insecticidal baits to animals was carried out by feeding to white mice. Probit analysis was used to calculate of median lethal doses of active ingredients and insecticidal baits. The selective toxicity was evaluated by the selective toxicity ratio, which was calculated by dividing the median lethal doses (LD50) of the active ingredients for white mice into LD50 for adult flies. The median lethal doses of acetamiprid and fipronil when applied alone for adult flies were 2.412 (2.023-2.862) and 0.087 (0.0285-0.2659) g of active ingredient per g of insect weight, respectively. The insecticidal activity of active ingredients, applied in combination, against adult flies increased by 15 and 5 times, respectively. For the toxicity to mice, median lethal doses of acetamiprid and fipronil in formulations containing only one of the active substances were 94.9 (88.5-101.8) mg/kg and more than 22.5 mg/kg of animal weight, respectively. The selective toxicity ratio of fipronil in the monocomponent formulation was 6.8 times higher than that of acetamiprid. For the binary formulation, the selectivity of fipronil and acetamiprid activity was equal. The combination of acetamiprid and fipronil resulted in an increase in their toxicity for adults Musca domestica and for white mice and a change in the selectivity of their activity compared to monocomponent formulations.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is an important base gas and can react with acidic species to form atmospheric aerosols. Due to the rapid growth of poultry and swine production in the North Carolina Coastal Plain, atmospheric NH3 concentrations across the region have subsequently increased. Ammonia concentrations and inorganic particulate matter (PM) at four ambient stations in the vicinity of an egg production facility were measured for 1 year using PM2.5 speciation samplers with honeycomb denuders and ion chromatography (IC). Meanwhile, concentrations of NH3 and inorganic PM in one of the egg production houses were also simultaneously measured using a gas analyzer for NH3 and the filter pack plus IC method for inorganic PM. An equilibrium model-ISORROPIA II was applied to predict the behavior of inorganic aerosols in response to precursor gas concentrations and environmental parameters. Average ambient NH3 concentrations varied from 10.0 to 27.0 mug/m(3), and they were negatively correlated with the distances from the ambient location to the nearest egg production house exhausts. Ambient NH3 concentrations were higher in warm seasons than in cold seasons. Measured NH3 concentrations agreed well with ISORROPIA II model predictions at all sampling stations. For the ambient stations, there was a good agreement in particle phase NH4 (+) between the model simulation and observations. For the in-house station, the model simulation was applied to correct the overestimation of particle phase NH4 (+) due to gas phase NH3 breaking through the denuders. Changes in SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), and Cl(-) yield proportional changes in inorganic PM mass. Due to the abundance of NH3 gas in the vicinity area of the monitored farm, changes in NH3 concentrations had a small effect on inorganic PM mass. Aerosol equilibrium modeling may be used to assess the influence of precursor gas concentrations on inorganic PM formation when the measurements for some species are unavailable.

AB  - Airborne bacteria and particulate matter (PM) emitted from animal houses may harm the environment and threaten on-farm and off-farm bio-security. Airborne transmission of PM and bacteria occurs more easily between double-tunnel ventilation layer hen houses with side-to-side arrangement due to the layout of inlet and outlet, and the accumulation of airborne contaminants in the intermediate region. This study practically applied shading nets for covering exhaust area and water disinfection for evaporative cooling system to prevent airborne transmission of PM and microbial aerosols between layer hen houses. Differences of PM and airborne culturable bacteria (CB) concentrations in control group and experimental group were used to evaluate the contaminants blocking effect of the treatment. PM and airborne microbial concentrations between houses were significantly higher than the upwind. Shading nets used as a barrier of PM and airborne bacteria had no significant effect on the reduction of inlet PM and airborne CB concentration of layer hen houses. The airborne CB concentration after evaporative cooling pads with water could be several times higher than that before. However, airborne CB concentration after the evaporative cooling pads with water disinfection was much lower than that before. Results indicated that shading net as a barrier of PM and airborne bacteria could hardly bring down contaminants concentrations near the inlet. Water disinfection for evaporative cooling system could largely reduce the inlet airborne CB concentration. Inlet air purification of animal houses is an effective way to prevent airborne microorganisms transmission. © 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds, VOCs, are air pollutants widely produced by biogenic and anthropogenic sources. This work quantitatively studied the presence of these gases in the internal and external environments of schools, comparing one in an urban area (La Salle School, Canoas, RS) and another in a rural area (Santa Cassia Farm School, Nova Santa Rita, RS). The aim of this study was to compare if this environmental differences (location) influence their gases concentration. Monitoring campaigns were conducted for 6months, occurring every 2weeks in both schools during class hours, 1day indoors and 1day outdoors. The results showed higher concentrations of total volatile organic compounds in the urban school external environment compared with the same rural school environment and, in the comparison between environments, the internal environments of the two schools obtained higher VOC concentrations than the external ones, except in November and December at the urban school.

AB  - Artificial membrane feeding systems are effective tools for both tick rearing and studying tick-borne pathogen transmission. In order to compare the effects of the type of feeding system on tick engorgement, Ixodes ricinus ticks were either fed on an artificial membrane feeding system or on live mice. Sheep and chicken blood were used with the membrane system to assess the effects of blood origin on tick engorgement. To investigate the effects of blood meal infection on tick engorgement, ticks were either fed with Bartonella-infected or uninfected blood, both via membrane feeding and on mice. The proportion of engorged ticks, the duration of tick feeding, and the weight of engorged ticks were assessed. Feeding on the artificial system led to a longer duration of tick feeding and a lower proportion of engorged ticks than when fed on mice, however, the weight of engorged ticks was unaffected. The proportion and weight of engorged ticks, as well as the duration of feeding were not affected by blood origin. Feeding on an infected blood meal or on infected mice decreased the proportion and the weight of engorged ticks, but did not affect tick feeding duration.

AB  - We investigated associations between prenatal and postnatal environmental factors and onset and remission of preschool childhood eczema across China. The study population was preschoolers in randomized day care centers in seven cities (N=39,782). Data on eczema and prenatal and postnatal indoor and outdoor environment were obtained from a cross-sectional questionnaire sent to parents or other guardians. Reports on eczema in the first 2years and in the past year was used to retrospectively calculate onset and remission (changes of reported eczema). Prenatal and postnatal outdoor temperature, NO2 and PM10 were modelled from official air pollution data. Associations were estimated by two-level logistic regression. Calculated onset rate was 3.2%/y and remission rate 29.2%/y. Exposure to NO2 during pregnancy was associated with onset of eczema, similarly for all trimesters. Postnatal PM10 and NO2 were related to decreased remission. Postnatal outdoor temperature was associated with onset of eczema. Pre-natal and current redecoration or buying new furniture, and perinatal as well as current dampness and indoor mould, were associated with increased onset and decreased remission. Cockroaches in current home was another indoor risk factors. Prenatal exposure to farm environment and large family size were all negatively associated with eczema. In conclusion, a warmer climate and prenatal NO2 can be associated with increased onset of eczema in Chinese preschoolers. Postnatal PM10 and NO2 can be associated with reduced remission. Perinatal and current dampness, indoor mould and cockroaches may increase onset and decrease remission. Exposure to chemical emissions from indoor materials after first year of life may increase onset. Prenatal exposure to farm environment and large family size could be protective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few Chinese population studies exist on early life risk factors for furry pet allergy.; OBJECTIVES: We studied childhood respiratory symptoms when in contact with furry pets in relation to early life exposure. Moreover, we studied similar environmental associations for rhinitis not related to furry pets.; METHODS: Children aged 3-6 y from day care centres in seven Chinese cities participated (N=39,782). Parents answered a questionnaire on home environment and children's health, including rhinoconjunctivitis and wheeze when in contact with furry pets, and diagnosed rhinitis. Prenatal and postnatal outdoor temperature, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 were calculated using data from monitoring stations. Associations were estimated by multilevel logistic regression.; RESULTS: Totally 2% had cats, 4% dogs, and 3.2% had rhinoconjunctivitis or wheeze when in contact with furry pets (FP symptoms). Moreover, 1.1% had furry pet related diagnosed rhinitis and 7.5% had diagnosed rhinitis not related to furry pets (other diagnosed rhinitis). Prenatal PM2.5 and PM10, especially in second trimester, and a colder climate were risk factors for FP symptoms. ETS, dampness and mould, condensation on windows in wintertime, and cats and dog keeping were associated with FP symptoms. Breast feeding and frequent window opening were protective. Similar indoor associations were found for furry pet related diagnosed rhinitis. ETS, dampness and mould, window condensation, urbanization and mechanical exhaust ventilation were risk factors for other diagnosed rhinitis. Cooking with an electric stove and early life exposure to animals (cats, dogs, farm environment during pregnancy) were protective for diagnosed rhinitis not related to furry pets.; CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal outdoor PM10 and PM2.5 can be risk factors for symptoms suggestive of furry pet allergy. Early life dampness and mould can be risk factors for rhinitis related and not related to furry pets. Exposure to animals (cats, dogs, farm environment) may reduce diagnosed rhinitis not related to furry pets. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soluble dietary fibers (SDF) are fermented more than insoluble dietary fibers (IDF), but their effect on colonic bacterial community structure and function remains unclear. Thus, bacterial community composition and function in the colon of BALB/c mice (n=7) fed with a high level (approximately 20%) of typical SDF, oat-derived beta-glucan (G), microcrystalline cellulose (M) as IDF, or their mixture (GM), were compared. Mice in group G showed a lowest average feed intake (p<0.05) but no change on the average body weight gain (p>0.05) compared to other groups, which may be associated with the highest concentration of colonic propionate (p<0.05) in these mice. The bacterial alpha-diversity of group G was significantly lower than other groups (p<0.01). In group G, the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes was significantly increased, whereas bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes were significantly decreased (p<0.01). The core bacteria for different treatments showed distinct differences. Bacteroides, Dehalobacterium, and Prevotella, including known acetogens and carbohydrate fermenting organisms, were significantly increased in relative abundance in group G. In contrast, Adlercreutzia, Odoribacter, and Coprococcus were significantly more abundant in group M, whereas Oscillospira, Desulfovibrio, and Ruminoccaceae, typical hydrogenotrophs equipped with multiple carbohydrate active enzymes, were remarkably enriched in group GM (p<0.05). The relative abundance of bacteria from the three classes of Proteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria (including Enterobacteriaceae) and Deltaproteobacteria, were significantly more abundant in group G, indicating a higher ratio of conditional pathogenic bacteria in mice fed dietary beta-glucan in current study. The predicted colonic microbial function showed an enrichment of "Energy metabolism" and "Carbohydrate metabolism" pathways in mice from group G and M, suggesting that the altered bacterial community in the colon of mice with the two dietary fibers probably resulted in a more efficient degradation of dietary polysaccharides. Our result suggests that the influence of dietary beta-glucan (SDF) on colonic bacterial community of mice was more extensively than MCC (IDF). Co-supplementation of the two fibers may help to increase the bacterial diversity and reduce the conditional pathogens in the colon of mice.

AB  - Introduction: Few investigations have related objective assessments of indoor air pollutants to respiratory health in farmers, in spite of the many rural environmental hazards to which they are exposed. Chemical air pollution has been particularly neglected.; Objective: We investigated the relationships of indoor exposure to particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to respiratory health in farmers.; Methods: NineteenVOCs (5 families) and PM (from ultrafine to total suspended particles (TSP)) were objectively assessed in dwellings and workplaces in 109 French farmers during a week. To take into account multiple exposures, scores of exposure were computed for total VOCs and VOCs families. Individuals filled a standardized questionnaire and underwent spirometry with bronchodilation test.; Results: On average, VOCs concentrations were higher in dwellings than in workplaces. The reverse was observed for PM. When considering the mean concentrations of air pollutants for the whole farm (dwellings + workplaces), asthma (9.3%) was positively associated with elevated exposure to benzene (adjusted odds-ratio (ORa)=6.64, 95%CI: 1.56-28.27), trichloroethylene (4.80, 1.00-23.30) and halogenated hydrocarbons score (2.9, 95% 1.3-6.8). Early airway obstruction (FEF25-75<80%, with normal FEV1 and FVC and FEV/FVC≥70%) (29.8%) was related to elevated exposure to 2-butoxyetylacetate (11.49, 1.55-85.37) and glycol ethers score (2.0; 1.0-4.1) in the whole farm and to PM2.5 (ORa=5.26, 95% CI: 1.09-25.28) in the granary/stable. The risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (FEV/FVC<70%) (COPD) (4.26%) was found to be larger with elevated exposure to aldehydes (OR=3.95, 1.09-14.26).; Conclusion: Indoor chemical air pollution is detrimental to farmers' respiratory health. More epidemiological investigations with detailed exposure assessments and clinical measures of respiratory effects are needed in rural settings to corroborate these findings. © The Author(s). 2019.

AB  - Laboratory animals at present day situation are one of the integral components of biomedical investigation, especially towards the translational research. Different types of animals like mouse, rat, rabbit etc. are used as laboratory animal. Including veterinary science, other branches of life science are also using Lab animals for drug testing, disease model studies, surgical investigations etc. Now a day's nearly all life science institutes have developed small or large, organized or non-organized animal house. Probably due to improper communication between Veterinarian/Lab animal experts and research worker or lack of awareness, many a times it is seen that there is improper management including housing, handling, breeding and even inappropriate selection of laboratory animal for research purposes. This may lead to wrong interpretation of research findings. Then again, animal handlers or research workers unknowingly become vulnerable to some of the hazardous allergens or zoonotic diseases. For that reason, proper management of laboratory animal following proper Ethical Guideline is a vital criterion for both accuracy of research findings and public health importance. Keeping these facts in vision the present topic will briefly deal with the hazards of lab animals and safety measures to be taken as well as Ethical issues related to laboratory animals.

AB  - Dairy farming is associated with an excess of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The dairy industry has been changing for the past three decades with larger, more efficient farms and potentially less exposure to agents involved in COPD development. However, the impact of farm modernisation on COPD prevalence is unknown. We studied respiratory symptoms, respiratory function by spirometry and tobacco smoking in 575 male dairy farmers working either in traditional or in modern farms in the French Doubs region. COPD was defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criterion (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) <0.70) and by the Quanjer reference equation (FEV1/FVC<lower limit of normal (LLN)). Modern farms were defined either as having a separation between the house and the cowshed (model 1) or as having a loose housing system for the animals (model 2). The prevalence of COPD in dairy farmers was 12.0 ± 2.7% (GOLD), and 5.6 ± 4.1% (LLN definition). By multivariate analysis using the LLN definition, tobacco smoking (OR (95% CI) 3.96 (1.53 to 10.3) and 3.42 (1.32 to 8.84) for models 1 and 2, respectively) and characteristics of traditional farms (1.97 (1.02 to 4.47) and 5.20 (1.73 to 15.64) for models 1 and 2, respectively) were associated with higher COPD prevalence. Working in a traditional farm plus current smoking had an additive effect on COPD prevalence in model 1 and a synergistic effect in model 2. These findings support a positive impact of farm modernity on COPD prevalence in dairy farmers. Occupational and smoking-related risk factors are of nearly the same magnitude.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in farm environments suggest that diverse microbial exposure promotes children's lung health. The underlying mechanisms are unclear, and the development of asthma-preventive strategies has been delayed. More comprehensive investigation of the environment-induced immunoregulation is required for better understanding of asthma pathogenesis and prevention. Exposure to air pollution, including particulate matter (PM), is a risk factor for asthma, thus providing an excellent counterpoint for the farm-effect research. Lack of comparable data, however, complicates interpretation of the existing information. We aimed to explore the immunoregulatory effects of cattle farm dust (protective, Finland) and urban air PM (high-risk, China) for the first time using identical research methods.; METHODS: We stimulated PBMCs of 4-year-old children (N=18) with farm dust and size-segregated PM and assessed the expression of immune receptors CD80 and ILT4 on dendritic cells and monocytes as well as cytokine production of PBMCs. Environmental samples were analysed for their composition.; RESULTS: Farm dust increased the percentage of cells expressing CD80 and the cytokine production of children's immune cells, whereas PM inhibited the expression of important receptors and the production of soluble mediators. Although PM samples induced parallel immune reactions, the size-fraction determined the strength of the effects.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the significance of using the same research framework when disentangling shared and distinctive immune pathways operating in different environments. Observed stimulatory effects of farm dust and inhibitory effects of PM could shape responses towards respiratory pathogens and allergens, and partly explain differences in asthma prevalence between studied environments. © 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Asthmatic school children (N=104 from 89 homes) of Louisa and Keokuk counties in Iowa (aged 5-14years) were recruited and block-randomized to receive extensive (education+professional cleaning) or educational interventions. Environmental sampling collection and respiratory survey administration were done at baseline and during three follow-up visits. Mixed-model analyses were used to assess the effect of the intervention on endotoxin levels and asthma symptoms in the main analysis and of endotoxin reduction on asthma symptoms in exploratory analysis. In the extensive intervention group, dust endotoxin load was significantly reduced in post-intervention visits. The extensive compared with the educational intervention was associated with significantly decreased dust endotoxin load in farm homes and less frequent nighttime asthma symptoms. In exploratory analysis, dust endotoxin load reduction from baseline was associated with lower total asthma symptoms score (Odds ratio: 0.52, 95% confidence interval: 0.29-0.92). In conclusion, the LEIP intervention reduced household dust endotoxin and improved asthma symptoms. However, endotoxin reductions were not sustained post-intervention by residents. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Rats that have restricted access to food at a fixed time point of the circadian phase display high levels of food anticipatory activity (FAA). The orexigenic hormone ghrelin has been implicated in the regulation of FAA. However, it is not known via which brain area ghrelin exerts this effect. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) is highly expressed in the hypothalamus, including the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). These two hypothalamic areas have been reported to play a role in FAA. Aim of the study: To examine the role of GHS-R1a signaling in the DMH and VMH in FAA. Design: Adeno-associated virus expressing a shRNA directed against GHS-R1a was used to establish local knockdown of GHS-R1a in the DMH and VMH in rats. Rats were subsequently subjected to a restricted feeding schedule (RFS). Results: Under ad libitum conditions, knockdown of GHS-R1a in the VMH increased food intake and body weight gain. In addition, GHS-R1a knockdown in VMH and DMH reduced body temperature and running wheel activity (RWA). When rats were subjected to a RFS, the main effect of GHS-R1a knockdown in both DMH and VMH was a decrease in RWA and an attenuation of body weight loss. Rats with knockdown of GHS-R1a in DMH and VMH showed a delay in onset of FAA. In addition, GHS-R1a knockdown in DMH resulted in a reduction of FAA amplitude. Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate the effect of local hypothalamic knockdown of GHS-R1a on FAA. Our results implicate hypothalamic GHS-R1a signaling in the regulation of FAA. Nevertheless, some FAA remained, suggesting that a distributed network of brain areas and signaling pathways is involved in the development of FAA.

AB  - Despite perceptions of pristine condition, upland environments are increasingly subject to a range of anthropogenic pressures including air pollution, climate change, land-use change and evolving land management strategies. Although they have received little attention to date, the large-scale development of upland wind farms also has the potential to disturb vegetation and soils, alter hydrology and water quality and, thus, impact freshwater ecosystems. This paper presents the findings of a 5-year study of the impacts of wind farm construction on the freshwater environment. Data on water quality, invertebrate and fish populations were collected for 2years before construction and for the following 3years covering the construction period and the initial period of the farm's operation. In contrast to previous studies, the impacts of the wind farm development were assessed for a suite of potentially affected hydrochemical variables using a before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis that allowed separation of construction effects from spatial and temporal variability in hydroclimatological conditions, thereby providing an improved, more robust evidence base. There was a small but significant negative effect of construction on pH, alkalinity (Alk) and acid neutralising capacity (ANC) in the upper part of the treatment catchment, which was where the wind farm was situated. The effects were more marked under higher flow conditions. It is hypothesised that this reflects changes in hydrological processes with increased near-surface runoff or organic acid mobilisation. There was no indication that either invertebrate community structure or fish densities were impacted by construction and the resulting effects on water quality.

AB  - Farm livestock manure is an important source of ammonia and greenhouse gases. Concerns over the environmental impact of emissions from manure management have resulted in research efforts focusing on emission abatement. However, questions regarding the successful abatement of manure-related emissions remain. This study uses a meta-analytical approach comprising 89 peer-reviewed studies to quantify emission reduction potentials of abatement options for liquid manure management chains from cattle and pigs. Analyses of emission reductions highlight the importance of accounting for interactions between emissions. Only three out of the eight abatement options considered (frequent removal of manure, anaerobic digesters, and manure acidification) reduced ammonia (3-60%), nitrous oxide (21-55%), and methane (29-74%) emissions simultaneously, whereas in all other cases, tradeoffs were identified. The results demonstrate that a shift from single-stage emission abatement options towards a whole-chain perspective is vital in reducing overall emissions along the manure management chain. The study also identifies some key elements like proper clustering, reporting of influencing factors, and explicitly describing assumptions associated with abatement options that can reduce variability in emission reduction estimates. Prioritization of abatement options according to their functioning can help to determine low-risk emission reduction options, specifically options that alter manure characteristics (e.g., reduced protein diets, anaerobic digestion, or slurry acidification). These insights supported by comprehensive emission measurement studies can help improve the effectiveness of emission abatement and harmonize strategies aimed at reducing air pollution and climate change simultaneously.

AB  - Considering environmental concerns regarding air pollution which is induced by burning fossil fuels to generate electrical power, utilizing solar energy as a green and sustainable energy source is of great interest. This study proposes a novel framework to determine the optimal location for constructing solar photovoltaic (PV) farms. To locate the suitable areas for PV farms, firstly, a fuzzy-based method is utilized to homogenize the input parameters, thereafter, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) methods are independently used. In the AHP method, the proper weight for each input parameter is generated utilizing a pairwise comparison matrix. However, the DS method identifies output in different confident levels. Finally, southeast of Fars province in Iran as a region with high sunny hours in the year is selected, and the applicability of proposed methods is examined. The results show that 32% of the case study is located at high and good suitability classes in the fuzzy_AHP method. However, it is 18.56%, 16.70%, 16.32% according to 95%, 99% and 99.5% confident levels in the fuzzy_DS method, respectively. Comparisons of the fuzzy_AHP and fuzzy_DS methods at 20 points with various solar radiation intensities and the number of dusty days parameters indicate that the fuzzy_DS method can more reliably determine the optimal PV farm locations. Additionally, as the fuzzy_DS method determines the optimal locations with different confident levels, this method can benefit decision-makers to determine the risks associated with selecting a specific site for constructing solar PV farms.

AB  - Numerous animal feeding studies have investigated the presence of DNA from transgenic plants in tissues from different animal species, but the data reported are sometimes controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transgenic DNA (tDNA) in the digesta and tissues of a meat rabbit breed fed genetically modified (GM) soybean meal. Fifteen male New Zealand White rabbits were used for the experimental trial. Ten rabbits (treated group [TG]) were fed a mixed feed containing 10% GM soybean meal and 5 rabbits (control group [CG]) received a mixed feed containing conventional soybean meal, both from weaning (28 d of age) to slaughter (803 d). Samples of blood, liver, kidney, heart, stomach, intestine (jejunum), lateral quadricep muscle, longissimus muscle, and perirenal adipose tissue were collected to assess the possible DNA transfer from GM feed to animal tissues. Samples of stomach contents and feces were also taken to study the degradability of ingested tDNA from feed in the digestive tract of rabbit. Moreover, samples of hair were collected to determine the possible environmental contamination from feed powders present on the farm. The DNA extraction was performed using specific genomic DNA kits. All samples were monitored, by using real-time PCR, for oligonucleotide primers and probes specific for the transgenic Roundup Ready soybean 40-3-2 and for the endogenous lectin (LE1) gene. As an internal control of rabbit tissues, the presence of the beta-actin (ACTB) gene was used. In this study, no fragments of tDNA were detectable in tissue DNA samples of rabbits except in the extracted DNA from stomach digesta, feces, and hair of rabbits fed with GM soybean. Similar results were found for the reference LE1 gene, whereas the presence of the ACTB gene was detected in all rabbit tissues. The lack of tDNA of soybean in rabbit tissues represents an important result, which demonstrates that meat from rabbits fed a diet containing GM feed is as that derived from rabbits fed conventional crops. The recombinant DNA recovered in the stomach digesta and in feces indicates an incomplete digestion of the soybean DNA in the gastrointestinal tract of the rabbit, whereas the presence of trace soybean transgene in the hair of the TG rabbits is suggestive of an environmental contamination.

AB  - The increasing attention for global warming is likely to contribute to the introduction of policies or other incentives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to livestock production, including dairy. The dairy sector is an important contributor to GHG emissions. Clinical mastitis (CM), an intramammary infection, results in reduced milk production and fertility, increases culling and mortality of cows and, therefore, has a negative impact on the efficiency (output/input) of milk production. This may increase GHG emissions per unit of product. Our objective was to estimate the impact of CM in dairy cows on GHG emissions of milk production for the Dutch situation. A dynamic stochastic simulation model was developed to simulate the dynamics and losses of CM for individual lactations. Cows receive a parity (1 to 5+), a milk production and a calving interval (CI). Based on the parity, cows have a risk of CM, with a maximum of three cases in a lactation. Pathogens causing CM were classified as gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, or other. Based on the parity and pathogen combinations, cows had a reduced milk production, discarded milk, prolonged CI and a risk of removal (culling and mortality) that reduce productivity of dairy cows and therefore increase GHG emissions per unit of product. Using life cycle assessment, emissions of GHGs were estimated from cradle to farm gate for processes along the milk production chain that are affected by CM. Processes included were feed production, enteric fermentation, and manure management. Emissions of GHGs were expressed as kg CO2 equivalents per ton of fat-and-protein-corrected milk (kg CO2e/t FPCM). Emissions of cows with CM increased on average by 57.5 (6.2%) kg CO2e/t FPCM compared with cows without CM. This increase was caused by removal (39%), discarded milk (38%), reduced milk production (17%) and prolonged CI (6%). The GHG emissions increased by 48 kg CO2e/t FPCM for cows with one case of CM, by 69 kg CO2e/t FPCM for cows with two cases of CM and by 92 kg CO2e/t FPCM for cows with three cases of CM compared with cows without CM. Preventing CM can be an effective strategy for farmers to reduce GHG emissions and can contribute to sustainable development of the dairy sector, because this also can improve the income of farmers and the welfare of cows. The impact of CM on GHG emissions, however, will vary between farms due to environmental conditions and management practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The highly consistent association of growing up on a farm with a reduced asthma risk has so far been attributed to direct farm exposure. In contrast, geographic determinants of the larger environment have never been assessed. In this study, the effects of proximity to farms and environmental variables in relation to the residential address on asthma and atopy were assessed.; METHODS: Addresses of 2265 children of the Bavarian arm of the GABRIELA study were converted into geocodes. Proximity to the nearest cow farm was calculated, and environmental characteristics were derived from satellite data or terrestrial monitoring. Bacterial diversity in mattress dust samples was assessed in 501 children by sequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicons. Logistic regression models were used to calculate associations between outcomes and exposure variables.; RESULTS: Asthma and atopy were inversely associated with the presence of a farm within a radius of maximum 100m. The environmental variables greenness, tree cover, soil sealing, altitude, air pollution differed not only between farm and non-farm children but also between farm children with and without another farm nearby. The latter distinction revealed strong associations with characteristics of traditional farms including a broader diversity of microbial exposure, which mainly contributed to the protective effect on asthma. In non-farm children, the protective effect of a farm nearby was completely explained by consumption of farm milk.; CONCLUSIONS: Clustering of farms within a neighborhood of 100m is strongly associated with the protective effect on asthma and may represent a more traditional style of farming with broader microbial exposure. © 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

AB  - Aims: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease of great socio-economic and public health importance in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice for treatment of schistosomiasis since it is effective against all species of schistosomes. However, PZQ is less efficacious against larval stages of the parasite and there are recent concerns that long term mass drug treatment could lead to development of drug resistant strains thus prompting the need for alternative antischistosomal drugs. Plants have over the years provided a rich source of novel drugs for a wide range of diseases afflicting man and domestic animals. Study Design: Swiss albino mice were infected and randomized into groups of five for plant extract treated groups, positive control groups treated with conventional drugs PZQ and artemether, as well as infected but untreated (negative control) groups. Place and Duration of Study: The study was done at the Animal Facility in the Centre for Biotechnology Research and Development, Kenya Medical Research Institute from July 2013 to July 2014. Methodology: Swiss albino mice were infected with 90 cercariae each and treated orally with varying doses of aqueous extracts of Ekebergia capensis and Azadirachta indica at doses of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg at 2 weeks (juvenile worms), 4 weeks (immature worms) and 7 weeks (adult worms) post infection. PZQ and artemether were used as positive controls while infected untreated group was used as negative controls. Total reduction of worm load as well as egg load in the liver and intestine was used as an indicator of drug activity, relative to the infected but untreated control groups. Results: Both E. capensis and A. indica showed significant dose-dependent percentage worm load reduction (P<0.05) at different doses ranging from 100 mg/kg to 400 mg/kg. These extracts also significantly reduced tissues (liver and intestine) egg load counts at doses ranging from 50 mg/kg to 400 mg/kg which was also dose-dependent. Conclusion: The antischistosomal activity of the two plant extracts was dose dependent with E. capensis being more potent in reducing both the worm burden at all the stages and tissue egg load. These findings validate the potential use of medicinal plants in the management of schistosomiasis and provide a basis for exploring medicinal plants as sources for new antischistosomal agents.

AB  - Air pollution generates hazardous pollutants that have resulted in safety, health, and other welfare issues of food animals. This paper reviewed scientific research advancement in food animal welfare-related air pollution based on 219 first-hand research publications in refereed journals (referred to as "RPs") over the past nine decades. Scientific studies in this area began in the 1930s. The number of RPs has increased significantly with each decade from the 1960s to the 1980s, then decreased until the 2010s. Twenty-six countries have contributed to this multidisciplinary research. About 52% of the studies were conducted in the U.S. and U.K. Research activities have surged in China since the 2010s. On-farm discoveries in air toxicity that resulted in animal death or injury were all from observational studies. About 75% of the studies were experimental and conducted primarily under laboratory conditions. Ammonia (NH3) was the main pollutant in 59% of the RPs, followed by dust, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), bacteria and endotoxins, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), silo gas, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and odor. Approximately 23% of RPs reported multiple pollutants in the same study. The most intensively studied animal species were poultry (broilers, hens, turkeys, ducks, and eggs and embryos in 44% of the RPs) and pigs (also 44%), followed by cattle, and sheep and goats. Scientific investigations in this area were driven by the research focuses in the areas of animal agriculture and industrial air pollution. Some major research teams played important roles in advancing scientific research. However, research in this area is still relatively limited. There is a great need to overcome some technical challenges and reverse the trend of decreasing research activities in North America and Europe. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data exist on asthma and rhinitis across China in relation to indoor and outdoor air pollution, climate and socioeconomic factors. The main aim was to study associations between asthma, rhinitis and current respiratory symptoms among pre-school children across China and selected indoor and outdoor exposure and indicators of socio-economic status (SES) in mutually adjusted models.; METHODS: Chinese children (3-6 yr.) (n = 39,782) were recruited from randomly selected day care centres in seven cities in China. Data on asthma, respiratory symptoms, rhinitis, indoor and outdoor exposure at home and SES were assessed by a parentally administered questionnaire. Lifetime mean ambient temperature, PM10, NO2, and GDP per capita on city level were calculated.; RESULTS: Totally 7.4% had ever doctors' diagnosed (DD) asthma and 8.7% DD-rhinitis, 19.7% had current wheeze, 45.0% rhinitis and 16.9% cough. DD-asthma was associated with ambient temperature (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.11-1.20 per °C), NO2 (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.33 per 10 mug/m3), indoor mould/dampness (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.39) and living near major roads (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25). DD-rhinitis was associated with ambient temperature (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.05-1.10 per °C), NO2 (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.32 per 10 mug/m3), GDP (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06 per 10,000 RenMinBi/year), indoor mould/dampness (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.11-1.35), passive smoking (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.21), and living near major roads (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.03-1.25). Children in suburban or rural areas, in larger families (≥5 persons) and with prenatal farm exposure had less DD-asthma and DD-rhinitis.; CONCLUSIONS: Economic development level of the city, higher SES, ambient temperature, NO2, PM10, traffic air pollution and mould/dampness can be risk factors for asthma and rhinitis and respiratory symptoms among pre-school children in China. Breastfeeding, large family size and early-life farm exposure could be protective factors. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The benefits and challenges of onshore and offshore wind energy development were assessed for a 4-county area of coastal Michigan. Economic, social, environmental, and spatial dimensions were considered. The coastal counties have suitable wind resources for energy development, which could contribute toward Michigan's 10% renewable energy standard. Wind energy is cost-effective with contract prices less than the benchmark energy price of a new coal-fired power plant. Constructing a 100MW wind farm could have a $54.7 million economic impact. A patchwork of township-level zoning ordinances regulates wind energy siting. Voluntary collaborations among adjacent townships standardizing the ordinances could reduce regulatory complexity. A Delphi Inquiry on offshore wind energy in Lake Michigan elicited considerable agreement on its challenges, but little agreement on the benefits to coastal communities. Offshore turbines could be acceptable to the participants if they reduced pollution, benefited coastal communities, involved substantial public participation, and had minimal impact on property values and tourism. The US Coast Guard will take a risk-based approach to evaluating individual offshore developments and has no plans to issue blanket restrictions around the wind farms. Models showed that using wind energy to reach the remainder of the 10% renewable energy standard could reduce SO2 , NOx , and CO2 pollution by 4% to 7%. Turbines are highly likely to impact the area's navigational and defense radar systems but planning and technological upgrades can reduce the impact. The integrated assessment shows that responsible wind energy development can enhance the quality of life by reducing air pollution and associated health problems and enhancing economic development. Policies could reduce the negative impacts to local communities while preserving the benefits to the broader region. © 2015 SETAC.

AB  - In this study, granular activated carbon (GAC) was used as an adsorbent for biogas desulfurization. Biogas containing 932-2,350ppm of H2S was collected from an anaerobic digester to treat the wastewater from a dairy farm with about 200 cows. An adsorption test was performed by introducing the biogas to a column that was packed with approximately 50L of commercial GAC. The operation ceased if the effluent gas had an H2S concentration of over 100ppm. The GAC was replaced by a given weight of new GAC in a subsequent test. According to the results, for H2S concentrations in the range of 932-1,560ppm (average±SD=1,260±256ppm), 1 kg of the GAC yielded biogas treatment capacities of 568±112 m3 and H2S adsorption capacities of 979±235g. For the higher influent H2S concentrations of 2,110±219ppm, the biogas treatment and H2S-adsorption capacities decreased to 229±18 m3 and 668±47g, respectively. An estimation indicated a requisite cost of US$16.5 for the purification of 1,000 m3 of biogas containing 2,110ppm of H2S. This cost is approximately 5% of US$330, the value of 1,000 m3 of biogas.; IMPLICATIONS: Biogas generated from anaerobic digesters of animal manure and municipal wastewater sludge contains hydrogen sulfide which must be removed before it can be combusted in electricity-generation engines. This study demonstrated that commercial activated carbon adsorption can be an economical and effective approach for removing hydrogen sulfide from biogas. In this study, granular activated carbon (GAC) was used as an adsorbent for biogas desulfurization. The biogas containing 932-2,350ppm of H2S was collected from an anaerobic digester for treating wastewater collected from a 200 dairy farm. The adsorption test was performed by introducing the biogas to a PVC column packed with a commercial GAC of around 50L. Operation ceased if the effluent gas had an H2S concentration of over 100ppm. A given weight of the new GAC was replaced for a successive test.

AB  - Volatile fatty acids (VFA) play an important role in the biodegradation of organic wastes and production of bioenergy under anaerobic digestion, and are related to malodors. However, little is known about the dynamics of VFA during dairy manure storage. This study evaluated the characteristics of VFA in dairy manure before and after anaerobic co-digestion in a laboratory experiment using eight lab-scale reactors. The reactors were loaded with four different types of dairy manure: (1) liquid dairy manure from a freestall barn, (2) mixture of dairy manure and co-digestion food processing wastes at the inlet of an anaerobic digester, (3) effluent from the digester outlet, and (4) the liquid fraction of effluent from a solid separator. Four VFA (acetic, propionic, butyric, and 2-methylbutyric acids) were identified and quantified in weekly manure samples from all reactors. Results showed that the dominant VFA was acetic acid in all four manure sources. The off-farm co-digestion wastes significantly increased the total VFA concentrations and the proportions of individual VFA in the influent. The dairy manure under storage demonstrated high temporal and spatial variations in pH and VFA concentrations. Anaerobic digestion reduced the total VFA by 86%-96%; but solid-liquid separation did not demonstrate a significant reduction in total VFA in this study. Using VFA as an indicator, anaerobic digestion exhibited an effective reduction of dairy manure odor offensiveness. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review on the "envirome" focuses on pollution, microbial, and social stressor elements of the environment that may impact development or expression of allergic diseases.; DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed publications on the impact of environmental factors indexed in PubMed were the primary data source for this review.; STUDY SELECTIONS: The primary search strategy for this review employed cross-referencing asthma, atopic dermatitis, and immunoglobulin E (IgE) against pollution (ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, tobacco smoke), microbial exposures (farm exposure, microbiome, infection, antibiotic use) and psychosocial stressors, with emphasis on results in the past 5 years, with inclusion of key seminal articles or comprehensive reviews.; RESULTS: Air pollution is a clear cause of allergic disease exacerbation, with increasing recognition that pollutant exposure increases risk of allergic disease. Microbial exposures and maternal and child stress also modulate development and expression of allergic disease. Early life exposures are especially critical periods during which all of these factors have notable impacts on allergic disease.; CONCLUSION: Nonallergenic environmental factors are important modulators and adjuvants for development of allergic disease, with early life exposures being especially important. Development and validation of interventions directed toward these factors during early life is a significant opportunity for primary prevention of allergic disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess whether medication use for obstructive airway diseases is associated with environmental exposure to livestock farms. Previous studies in the Netherlands at a regional level suggested that asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are less prevalent among persons living near livestock farms.; METHODS: A nationwide population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 7,735,491 persons, with data on the dispensing of drugs for obstructive airway diseases in the Netherlands in 2016. Exposure was based on distances between home addresses and farms and on modelled atmospheric particulate matter (PM10) concentrations from livestock farms. Data were analysed for different regions by logistic regression analyses and adjusted for several individual-level variables, as well as modelled PM10 concentration of non-farm-related air pollution. Results for individual regions were subsequently pooled in meta-analyses.; RESULTS: The probability of medication for asthma or COPD being dispensed to adults and children was lower with decreasing distance of their homes to livestock farms, particularly cattle and poultry farms. Increased concentrations of PM10 from cattle were associated with less dispensing of medications for asthma or COPD, as well (meta-analysis OR for 10th-90th percentile increase in concentration of PM10 from cattle farms, 95%CI: 0.92, 0.86-0.97 for adults). However, increased concentrations of PM10 from non-farm sources were positively associated (meta-analysis OR for 10th-90th percentile increase in PM10-concentration, 95%CI: 1.29, 1.09-1.52 for adults).; CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the probability of dispensing medication for asthma or COPD is inversely associated with proximity to livestock farms and modelled exposure to livestock-related PM10 in multiple regions within the Netherlands. This finding implies a notable prevented risk: under the assumption of absence of livestock farms in the Netherlands, an estimated 2%-5% more persons (an increase in tens of thousands) in rural areas would receive asthma or COPD medication.

AB  - RATIONALE: Asthma, frequently associated with rhinitis, is the most common chronic disease in children, and a significant role is played by a range of environmental exposures. Among them, air pollution is of foremost concern. However, little is known about the impact of airborne pesticide exposure on children's respiratory health in rural areas. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between airborne pesticide exposure and asthma and rhinitis in children.; METHODS: In a French vineyard rural area, children (3-10 years old) from 4 selected schools were invited to participate in this study over two periods: winter, with no or low air pesticide levels, and summer when fields are frequently treated with pesticides. Two health outcomes were considered: asthma and rhinitis symptoms (ISAAC questionnaire), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). A quantitative score of symptoms was built. Exposure to pesticides was evaluated 1) by measuring 56 pesticides in the ambient outdoor air around schools in the two periods and building a cumulative exposure index, and 2) by measuring ethylenethiourea (ETU) concentrations in urine in a subsample of children (n = 96), ETU being a urine biomarker of exposure to dithiocarbamates fungicides. Next, the association between pesticide exposure and respiratory health was studied using a logistic regression model, adjusted for confounders and respiratory status at baseline.; RESULTS: 281 children participated in the study (47% girls, mean age: 7.5 yrs). 25% of the children were living on a farm. 22% had experienced wheezing at least once. 15.8% had asthma diagnosed by a doctor, 12% had current asthma and 35% had allergic rhinitis. The main pesticides detected in the ambient outdoor air around schools were fungicides (89,3%; mainly folpet and dithiocarbamates) and insecticides (10.6%). No association was found between the symptom score and pesticides in the outdoor air around schools during summer, when pesticides were applied to vineyards. However, an association was found between ETU urinary concentration (>0.974 mug/g creatinine) and asthma and rhinitis symptoms (OR=3.56; IC 95% 1.04-12.12). This result could be explained by extracurricular exposure, which was not considered in our air measurements in the schools. No association was found between peak expiratory flow and exposure to pesticides in the air.; CONCLUSIONS: Children living in vineyard rural areas are at a higher risk of airborne dithiocarbamates exposure during the summer period. Despite the limited size of our sample, our results suggest possible links between some pesticide measurements and respiratory and allergic symptoms such as rhinitis. Copyright © 2018.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota is involved in many physiological processes and it is increasingly recognized that differences in community composition can influence the outcome of a variety of murine models used in biomedical research. In an effort to describe and account for the variation in intestinal microbiota composition across the animal facilities of participating members of the DFG Priority Program 1656 "Intestinal Microbiota", we performed a survey of C57BL/6J mice from 21 different mouse rooms/facilities located at 13 different institutions across Germany. Fresh feces was sampled from five mice per room/facility using standardized procedures, followed by extraction and 16S rRNA gene profiling (V1-V2 region, Illumina MiSeq) at both the DNA and RNA (reverse transcribed to cDNA) level. In order to determine the variables contributing to bacterial community differences, we collected detailed questionnaires of animal husbandry practices and incorporated this information into our analyses. We identified considerable variation in a number of descriptive aspects including the proportions of major phyla, alpha- and beta diversity, all of which displayed significant associations to specific aspects of husbandry. Salient findings include a reduction in alpha diversity with the use of irradiated chow, an increase in inter-individual variability (beta diversity) with respect to barrier access and open cages and an increase in bacterial community divergence with time since importing from a vendor. We further observe a high degree of facility-level individuality, which is likely due to each facility harboring its own unique combination of multiple varying attributes of animal husbandry. While it is important to account and control for such differences between facilities, the documentation of such diversity may also serve as a valuable future resource for investigating the origins of microbial-driven host phenotypes.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate how the feeding strategy of rabbit kits at the onset of solid feed intake could affect ecological diversity and co-occurrence patterns of the cecal bacterial community. From birth to 18 days of age kits were exclusively milk-fed, and between 18 and 35 days the young rabbits also had access to solid feed. After weaning at (35 days), young rabbits were exclusively fed solid feed. Three experimental feeds were used: a high concentrate diet [H: 10.16 MJ digestible energy (DE)/kg and 15.3% crude protein (CP)], a low concentrate diet (L: 9.33 MJ DE/kg and 14.7% CP) and a reproductive female diet (R: 10.57 MJ DE/kg and 17.3% CP). The rabbit kits (n=357) were divided into three groups, differing by the diet received during two periods: from 18 to 28 and from 28 to 49 days of age. In the groups LL and HH, rabbit kits were fed L or H diets, respectively, during both periods. Kits in the group RL received feeds R and L from 18 to 28 and 28 to 49 days of age, respectively. Cecal bacterial communities of 10 rabbits per group were carried out at 18, 28, 35, 43 and 49 days of age by MiSeq Illumina sequencing 16S rRNA encoding genes. Between 18 and 28 days of age, solid feed intake was higher in the group RL compared to the other two groups (+24%; P0.01). Overall, 13.4% of the OTUs detected were present in the cecal ecosystem from 18 to 49 days old, whereas 17.4% were acquired with the onset of solid feeding and kept from 28 days on. Exclusive milk consumption constrains the bacterial community toward a similar structure but high phylogenetic beta-diversity. Introduction of solid feed induced a sharp change of microbial community structure and decreased phylogenetic diversity. A strong relationship in bacterial community network occurred only from 43 days on. Our feeding strategy at the onset of solid feed ingestion exhibited only a moderate effect on the microbial community structure (P=0.072), although the LL group seemed to reach faster maturity compared to the two other groups.

AB  - Microorganisms found in bioaerosols from animal confinement buildings not only foster the risk of spreading diseases among livestock buildings, but also pose health hazards to farm workers and nearby residents. This study identified the various microorganisms present in the air of swine, chicken, and cattle farms with different kinds of ventilation conditions in Korea. Microbial air samples were collected onto Petri dishes with bacterial or fungal growth media using a cascade impactor. Endotoxin levels in total dust were determined by the limulus amebocyte lysate kinetic QCL method. Prevalent Gram-positive bacteria were Staphylococcus (S.) lentus, S. chromogenes, Bacillus (B.) cereus, B. licheniformis, and Enterococcus faecalis, while the dominant fungi and Gram-negative bacteria were Candida albicans and Sphingomonas paucimobilis, respectively. Considering no significant relationship between the indoor dust endotoxin levels and the isolation of Gram-negative bacteria from the indoor air, monitoring the indoor airborne endotoxin level was found to be also critical for risk assessment on health for animals or workers. The present study confirms the importance of microbiological monitoring and control on animal husbandry indoor air to ensure animal and worker welfare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Air emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) have been associated with respiratory and allergic symptoms among farm workers, primarily on swine farms. Despite the increasing prevalence of CAFOs, few studies have assessed respiratory health implications among residents living near CAFOs and few have looked at the health impacts of dairy CAFOs.; OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine objective and subjective measures of respiratory and allergic health among rural residents living near dairy CAFOs in a general population living in the Upper Midwest of the United States.; METHODS: Data were from the 2008-2016 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) cohort (n = 5338), a representative, population based sample of rural adults (age 18+). The association between distance to the nearest CAFO and the prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosed allergies, asthma, episodes of asthma in the last 12 months, and asthma medication use was examined using logistic regression, adjusting for covariates and sampling design. Similarly, the association between distance to the nearest CAFO and lung function, measured using spirometry, was examined using multivariate linear regression. Restricted cubic splines accounted for nonlinear relationships between distance to the nearest CAFO and the aforementioned outcomes.; RESULTS: Living 1.5 miles from a CAFO was associated with increased odds of self-reported nasal allergies (OR = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.38, 3.14), lung allergies (OR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.59, 4.66), asthma (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.39, 5.13), asthma medication (OR = 3.31; 95% CI: 1.65 6.62), and uncontrolled asthma, reported as an asthma episode in last 12 months (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.11, 4.92) when compared to living 5 miles from a CAFO. Predicted FEV1 was 7.72% (95% CI: -14.63, -0.81) lower at a residential distance 1.5 miles from a CAFO when compared with a residence distance of 3 miles from a CAFO.; CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest CAFOs may be an important source of adverse air quality associated with reduced respiratory and allergic health among rural residents living in close proximity to a CAFO.

AB  - Air pollutants accumulated in confined livestock barns could impact the health of animals and staff. Particulate matter (PM) and ammonia (NH3) concentrations are typically high in enclosed livestock houses with weak ventilation. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of PM in different size fractions and the levels of NH3 in a high-rise nursery (HN) barn and a high-rise fattening (HF) barn on a swine farm and to analyse the physicochemical properties of fine PM (PM2.5, PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 mum). The concentrations of total suspended particles (TSP, PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 100 mum), inhalable PM (PM10, PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 mum), PM2.5 and NH3 were monitored continuously for 6 d in each barn. The results showed that the concentrations of PM and NH3 varied with position, they were significantly higher inside the barns than outside (P < 0.01) and significantly higher in the forepart than at the rear of the two barns (P < 0.05). In the HF barn, the values of the two parameters were 0.777 ± 0.2 mg m-3 and 26.7 ± 7 mg m-3, respectively, significantly higher than the values observed in the HN barn at all monitored sites (P < 0.05). The PM concentrations increased markedly during feeding time in the two barns. Chemical characteristics analysis revealed that the main sources of PM2.5 in the two barns may have consisted of blowing dust, feed, mineral particles and smoke. In conclusion, the air quality at the forepart was worse than that at the rear of the barns. Activities such as feeding could increase the PM concentrations. The components of PM2.5 in the two barns were probably blowing dust, feed, mineral particles and smoke from outside. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As an integral part of the Coalition for Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES) Project, this study simultaneously monitored air emissions of 3 commercially operated egg production systems at the house level and associated manure storage over 2 single-cycle flocks (18 to 78 wk of age). The 3 housing systems were 1) a conventional cage house (CC) with a 200,000-hen capacity (6 hens in a cage at a stocking density of 516 cm2/hen), 2) an enriched colony house (EC) with a 50,000-hen capacity (60 hens per colony at a stocking density of 752 cm2/hen), and 3) an aviary house (AV) with a 50,000-hen capacity (at a stocking density of 1253 to 1257 cm2/hen). The 3 hen houses were located on the same farm and were populated with Lohmann white hens of the same age. Indoor environment and house-level gaseous (ammonia [NH3] and greenhouse gasses [GHG], including carbon dioxide [CO2], methane [CH4], and nitrous oxide [N2O]) and particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5) emissions were monitored continually. Gaseous emissions from the respective manure storage of each housing system were also monitored. Emission rates (ERs) are expressed as emission quantities per hen, per animal unit (AU, 500 kg live BW), and per kilogram of egg output. House-level NH3 ER (g/hen/d) of EC (0.054) was significantly lower than that of CC (0.082) or AV (0.112) (P<0.05). The house-level CO2 ER (g/hen/d) was lower for CC (68.3) than for EC and AV (74.4 and 74.0, respectively), and the CH4 ER (g/hen/d) was similar for all 3 houses (0.07 to 0.08). The house-level PM ER (mg/hen/d), essentially representing the farm-level PM ER, was significantly higher for AV (PM10 100.3 and PM2.5 8.8) than for CC (PM10 15.7 and PM2.5 0.9) or EC (PM10 15.6 and PM2.5 1.7) (P<0.05). The farm-level (house plus manure storage) NH3 ER (g/hen/d) was significantly lower for EC (0.16) than for CC (0.29) or AV (0.30) (P<0.05). As expected, the magnitudes of GHG emissions were rather small for all 3 production systems. Data from this study enable comparative assessment of conventional vs. alternative hen housing systems regarding air emissions and enhance the U.S. national air emissions inventory for farm animal operations. © The Author 2015.

AB  - Inhalation of organic dust or endotoxin in the dust is considered a major risk factor for occupational respiratory illnesses. Eighteen environmental characteristics associated with animal husbandry were surveyed at 36 swine farms in seven provinces throughout South Korea. Association of these factors with levels of indoor inhalable or respirable dust or endotoxin in each type of dust was analyzed using backward stepwise multiple linear regression models. Mean levels of inhalable and respirable dust were 0.5 ± 0.35 and 0.13 ± 0.12 mg/m3 air, respectively, and mean endotoxin levels were 676 ± 463 and 48.4 ± 68.2 EU/m3, respectively, in each dust. Factors negatively associated with inhalable dust levels included pig age, indoor farm temperature, number of pigs in the building, hr/week of indoor farm work, and partly slatted floor. Factors positively associated with inhalable dust levels included floor cleaning by manual scraping and slurry deposit duration. Factors negatively associated with the level of endotoxin in inhalable dust included pig age, temperature, number of pigs, hr/week of indoor farm work, and partly slatted floor. Factors negatively associated with respirable dust level included area of the confinement building, whereas factors positively associated with respirable dust level included the number of pigs and stocking density. Endotoxin levels in respirable dust were negatively associated with h/week of indoor farm work and partly slatted floor. Overall, data suggest that husbandry variables may be adjusted to control dust and airborne endotoxin levels in swine farms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is an ongoing debate regarding environmental health risks of exposures to dust and microbial agents from livestock farming in the Netherlands. The aims of the study were (1) to investigate associations between indicators of air pollution from livestock farms and asthma, allergic rhinitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among neighbouring residents; and (2) to assess associations between farm exposures and endotoxin levels in participants' homes.; METHODS: Electronic medical records of all 92 548 patients of 27 general practices in a rural area with a high density of animal farms were analysed, followed up by a case-control component using a subsample of the full population. Distance between livestock farms and home address, presence of livestock within 500 m, and particulate matter (PM)10 emissions from farms within 500 m were computed as proxies for farm exposure. Potential confounding was investigated through a case-control questionnaire study in 269 adult patients with asthma and 546 controls. Endotoxin levels were assessed in 493 homes.; RESULTS: Modelled PM10 emission was inversely associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis and COPD (p<0.05). A smaller distance to the nearest farm, and the presence of swine, goat and sheep farms were also inversely related to respiratory morbidity, whereas mink farms showed positive associations with asthma and allergic rhinitis. Adjustment for confounding in the case-control study did not change results. Farm exposures were not associated with endotoxin levels in neighbouring residents' homes.; CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, indicators of air pollution from livestock farms were inversely associated with respiratory morbidity among neighbouring residents.

AB  - Studies have linked air pollution exposure to cardiovascular health effects, but it is not clear which components drive these effects. We examined the associations between air pollution exposure and circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts in humans. To investigate independent contributions of particulate matter (PM) characteristics, we exposed 31 healthy volunteers at five locations with high contrast and reduced correlations amongst pollutant components: two traffic sites, an underground train station, a farm and an urban background site. Each volunteer visited at least three sites and was exposed for 5h with intermittent exercise. Exposure measurements on-site included PM mass and number concentration, oxidative potential (OP), elemental- and organic carbon, metals, O3 and NO2. Total and differential WBC counts were performed on blood collected before and 2 and 18h post-exposure (PE). Changes in total WBC counts (2 and 18h PE), number of neutrophils (2h PE) and monocytes (18h PE) were positively associated with PM characteristics that were high at the underground site. These time-dependent changes reflect an inflammatory response, but the characteristic driving this effect could not be isolated. Negative associations were observed for NO2 with lymphocytes and eosinophils. These associations were robust and did not change after adjustment for a large suite of PM characteristics, suggesting an independent effect of NO2. We conclude that short-term air pollution exposure at real-world locations can induce changes in WBC counts in healthy subjects. Future studies should indicate if air pollution exposure-induced changes in blood cell counts results in adverse cardiovascular effects in susceptible individuals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Agricultural hygiene and biomonitoring helps protect people, livestock and crops from pests and disease, including insects, parasites, pathogens and weeds. Optimising the health of animals and crops increases productivity, minimises animal suffering, and ultimately protects human health by ensuring that foodstuffs are safe for consumption. A healthy farm environment also protects the health of the agricultural workers. Ensuring hygiene and health protection is one of the basic construction requirements. Such requirements are examined when commissioning new constructions and examining defects in constructions already in use. One substantial defect is biocorrosion which represents a synergistic process with a complex variety of factors, caused by biochemical manifestations of various micro-organisms micromycetes). Micromycetes producing mycotoxins therefore play an important role regarding the so-called 'Sick Building Syndrome' (SBS) that has become a global problem nowadays. Therefore, agricultural hygiene and biomonitoring aims to minimise the introduction of additional pathogens and pests, as well as the spread of pathogens and pests in farm environments; this helps protect the safety of foodstuffs further down the supply chain.; OBJECTIVE: The aim of the presented study is to point out the need to address indoor environment monitoring, summarizing the most commonly used methods for monitoring biological factors, and characterizing the negative effects of biological agents on humans and animals exposed to their negative effects.

AB  - Ammonia adsorbents effective even in trace concentrations are key to the countermeasure for air pollution of particulate matter caused by ammonia emission from agriculture sectors. We revealed that Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs), one of the porous coordination polymers, have higher ammonia adsorption capacity in 10 ppmv of ammonia (parts per million in volume, 10 ppmv = 0.0001 volume percent), ≥8 times that of conventional adsorbents. Moreover, these compounds can be recycled only through water flushing. The adsorption capacity of PBA was restricted to 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption, and the air sample for the experiment was collected from the composting equipment present in a swine farm. Despite the presence of saturated water vapor in the exhaust gas, the adsorbents showed excellent selectivity in the removal of ammonia from the sample.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. Osteoporosis, the "quiet epidemic", is one of the most serious threats to public health. It is known that estrogen plays a significant role in the regulation of bone turnover, and its loss at menopause causes osteoporosis. Added to this, insufficient calcium intake accelerates bone mass loss, increasing the risk of fractures. Objective. The study aimed to answer the question whether a fructan-enriched diet could be helpful in preventing from disturbances in bone turnover caused by calcium restriction combined with ovariectomy-induced estrogen deficiency. The differences related to the kind of fructan and "matrix effect" of fructan action (form of addition) were also evaluated. Materials and method. The study was conducted using sham-operated (control groups) or ovariectomized (OVX) rats fed a calcium restricted diet. The treatment diets contained one of three fructan sources - Jerusalem artichoke, yacon and Beneo Orafti Synergy1 - added alone or as an ingredient of strawberry sorbet, all in the amount providing 8% fructans. Analyses of biological material included: serum Ca, Mg and P concentrations, alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and C-telopeptide degradation products from type I collagen (CTX). Densitometric parameters of femora were also assayed. Results. Among markers of bone turnover, the ALP activity depended both on the kind of fructan and the form of addition. The highest value was shown in the OVX group fed a low-calcium diet, whereas administration of diet enriched with Jerusalem artichoke led to an almost 50% decrease in the value of this parameter. Dietary fructans also lowered the OC level. Feeding rats with diet containing sorbet enriched in yacon or Jerusalem artichoke resulted in a decrease of CTX, compared to the diet containing yacon alone or fructan formulation in both forms No significant differences were observed in densitometric parameters between treatment groups. Conclusions. The obtained findings suggest that fructan administration with a calcium-restricted diet might exert a positive effect on bone turnover parameters. Regarding the form of their addition, it is possible that other constituents of sorbets contributed to the fructan action. It remains open whether this impact would be significant over a longer period of time.

AB  - In less than a decade since its identification in 2009, the emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris has become a major public health threat due to its multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype, high transmissibility, and high mortality. Unlike other Candida species, C. auris has acquired high levels of resistance to an already limited arsenal of antifungals. As an emerging pathogen, there are currently a limited number of documented murine models of C. auris infection. These animal models use inoculums as high as 107-108 cells per mouse, and the environmental and occupational exposure of working with these models has not been clearly defined. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture, we monitored the animal holding room as well as the procedure room for up to 6 months while working with an intravenous model of C. auris infection. This study determined that shedding of the organism is dose-dependent, as detectable levels of C. auris were detected in the cage bedding when mice were infected with 107 and 108 cells, but not with doses of 105 and 106 cells. Autoclaving bedding in closed micro-isolator cages was found to be an effective way to minimize exposure for animal caretakers. We found that tissue necropsies of infected mice were also an important source of potential source exposure to C. auris. To mitigate these potential exposures, we implemented a rigorous "buddy system" workflow and a disinfection protocol that uses 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol and can be used in any animal facility when using small animal models of C. auris infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crop residue burning adversely affects air quality and consequently human health. India, being one of the largest agro-economies of the world, produces around 500 Million tonnes of crop residue annually most of which is burnt on-farm. However, integrated studies that simultaneously quantify the effects of crop residue burning while exploring the subjective determinants of the practice are lacking in India. This paper describes the protocol for a longitudinal mixed methods research study employing a community-based participatory approach to fill this gap.; METHODS: Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected in a rural setting of the central Indian province of Madhya Pradesh, over 1 year. A steering committee comprising of the research team and community representatives will be formed. The proportion of cultivable land burnt in one crop burning season will be estimated. The association between crop residue burning, level of ambient air pollutants, and pulmonary function of village residents will be determined. Focus groups, interviews, and participatory rural appraisal methods will be used to explore stakeholder perspectives about crop residue burning. Potential barriers and opportunities for substituting burning with an alternative crop residue management technique will be ascertained as the basis for future interventions. Ethics approval has been obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of the National Institute for Research in Environmental Health (No: NIREH/BPL/IEC/2019-20/1494, dt 06/01/2020).; DISCUSSION: This manuscript describes the protocol for a novel community-based participatory study to investigate thoroughly the phenomenon of crop residue burning from the perspective of the agricultural community through their active collaboration. The lack of comprehensive evidence regarding the factors responsible for crop residue burning in India underlines the importance of implementing this study protocol to fill in this critical gap in knowledge. While acknowledging that findings of this study will be not generalizable to agricultural communities other than the one studied, it is expected that the study will generate baseline evidence that might be beneficial in developing and implementing an appropriate intervention strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in prevalence of asthma and atopic diseases in Western countries has been linked to aspects of microbial exposure patterns of people. It remains unclear which microbial aspects contribute to the protective farm effect.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify bacterial groups associated with prevalence of asthma and atopy, and to quantify indoor exposure to some of these bacterial groups.; METHODS: A DNA fingerprinting technique, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), was applied to mattress dust samples of farm children and control children in the context of the GABRIEL Advanced study. Associations between signals in DGGE and atopy, asthma and other allergic health outcomes were analyzed. Quantitative DNA based assays (qPCR) for four bacterial groups were applied on the dust samples to seek quantitative confirmation of associations indicated in DNA fingerprinting.; RESULTS: Several statistically significant associations between individual bacterial signals and also bacterial diversity in DGGE and health outcomes in children were observed. The majority of these associations showed inverse relationships with atopy, less so with asthma. Also, in a subsequent confirmation study using a quantitative method (qPCR), higher mattress levels of specifically targeted bacterial groups - Mycobacterium spp., Bifidobacteriaceae spp. and two different clusters of Clostridium spp. - were associated with a lower prevalence of atopy.; CONCLUSION: DNA fingerprinting proved useful in identifying bacterial signals that were associated with atopy in particular. These findings were quantitatively confirmed for selected bacterial groups with a second method. High correlations between the different bacterial exposures impede a clear attribution of protective effects to one specific bacterial group. More diverse bacterial flora in mattress dust may link to microbial exposure patterns that protect against development of atopic diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of sleep of employees in the German offshore wind industry and to explore factors associated with poor sleep quality.; DESIGN: Web-based cross-sectional survey.; SETTING: Offshore companies operating in wind farms within the German exclusive economic zone.; PARTICIPANTS: Workers with regular offshore commitments and at least 28 days spent offshore in the past year (n=268).; OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep quality in the past 4weeks, troubles falling asleep or sleeping through in the past 4weeks, differences in sleep quality between offshore deployments and onshore leaves.; RESULTS: Having problems with sleep onset was reported by 9.5% of the respondents. 16.5% reported troubles with maintaining sleep three or more times per week. The overall quality of sleep was rated as very bad by only 1.7% of the participants. 47.9% of the workers reported their quality of sleep to be worse during offshore commitments than when being onshore. Higher levels of exposition to noise, vibrations and poor air quality were associated with sleeping troubles and poorer sleep quality. Sharing the sleep cabin with colleagues was associated with troubles sleeping through. No association was found for working in rotating shifts and for regularity of the offshore commitments.; CONCLUSIONS: Workers in our study showed frequent sleep problems and poorer sleep quality offshore than onshore. Our results indicate that higher degrees of exposure to noise, vibrations and artificial ventilation are associated with poor sleep quality rather than organisational factors such as shift-work and type of working schedule. In view of the high demands of the offshore workplace and the workers' particular recovery needs, addressing sleep disorders should be part of any health and safety management strategy for this workplace. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

AB  - This study provided a reliable way to identify and estimate the ergosterol in farm environments, since it is renowned that it is a specific indicator for the occurrence of molds and yeasts. The quick valuation of exposure to airborne microorganisms is essential to assess the risk to which the health of employees is subjected in working places characterized by great humidity. From this view, it is worth estimating the total biomass of molds and yeast, including viable and non-viable forms, which may cause respiratory concerns to human. Air samples were collected with a passive method and the microbial growth was evaluated with a traditional counting method. At the same time, the ergosterol was quantified from yeasts and molds. In this way, the aerosol concentrations of molds and yeasts were compared by using the two methods, the cultivation on plates, as well as through ergosterol measurement by means of UV spectroscopy. Results showed, for the first time, a positive correlation between the amount of ergosterol and the yeast cells. Based on these outcomes, the ergosterol is a statistically significant biomarker to be used to control the air quality of indoor and outdoor farm spaces, by means of a simple and direct UV procedure. © FEMS 2017.

AB  - Excessive nitrogen (N) fertilizers are often used in China, and a large proportion of the N can be lost as ammonia (NH3). However, quantifying the NH3 emission from paddy fields is always affected by large uncertainties due to different measuring methods and other factors such as climate. In this study, using a standardized method, we measured the NH3 emissions in three typical annual rice cropping systems: single rice, double rice and rotation with other crops. The measurements were conducted for 2 years with a total of 3131 observations across China. Results showed that NH3 emissions accounted for 17.7% (14.4-21.0%) of the N applied under current farm practice, which was 33.1% (10.6-52.6%) higher than previous estimates. Nitrogen application rate was the dominant factor influencing NH3 emission rate, which exponentially increased with the N fertilizer rate (p < .001). Total NH3 emissions from paddy fields were estimated at 1.7 Tg N yr-1 in 2013 in China, several times the amount of N lost through leaching or runoff. This suggests that mitigation measures for non-point source pollution from cropland should take into account not only the N lost to water, but also to air, thereby improving air quality.

AB  - Pollutant gases and particulate matters (PM) from livestock facilities can affect the health of animals and farm workers and lead to great social environmental risks. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the characteristics of ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and PM (including PM2.5 and PM10) in a 100,000-bird manure-belt layer house in suburb Beijing for three typical seasons of summer, autumn and winter. Indoor air was sampled at an exhaust fan of the mechanically ventilated commercial house. The monitored indoor concentrations of NH3, NOx, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10 were 3.7-5.0mgm-3, 17-58mugm-3, 0-11mugm-3, 100-149mugm-3 and 354-828mugm-3, respectively. The indoor NH3 concentrations were largely influenced by the manure removal frequency. The NOx and SO2 were mainly sourced from the ambient air, and the NOx was also partly sourced from manure decomposition in summer. The indoor PM2.5 and PM10 were largely sourced from the ambient air and the indoor manure, respectively. The abundant indoor NH3 caused significantly higher NH4+ concentration in the indoor PM10 (7.98±9.04mugm-3) than that in the ambient PM10 (3.48±3.52mugm-3). Secondary inorganic ions (SO42-, NO3- and NH4+) totally contributed 5.7% and 14.6% to the indoor and ambient PM2.5, respectively; they contributed 2.8% and 8.9% to the indoor and ambient PM10, respectively. Organic carbon was the main component of the PM and accounted for 26.6% and 41.5% of the indoor PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. Heavy metal elements (Zn, Cu and Cr) were likely transported from feed to manure and finally accumulated in the PM. Given the high emission potential, the air pollutants from animal production suggested potential risks for human health. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biosecurity is defined as the implementation of measures that reduce the risk of disease agents being introduced and/or spread. For pig production, several of these measures are routinely implemented (e.g. cleaning, disinfection, segregation). However, air as a potential vector of pathogens has long been disregarded. Filters for incoming and recirculating air were installed into an already existing ventilation plant at a fattening piggery (3,840 pigs at maximum) in Saxony, Germany. Over a period of three consecutive fattening periods, we evaluated various parameters including air quality indices, environmental and operating parameters, and pig performance. Animal data regarding respiratory diseases, presence of antibodies against influenza A viruses, PRRSV, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and lung health score at slaughter were recorded, additionally. There were no significant differences (p = 0.824) in total bacterial counts between barns with and without air filtration. Recirculating air filtration resulted in the lowest total dust concentration (0.12 mg/m3) and lung health was best in animals from the barn equipped with recirculating air filtration modules. However, there was no difference in animal performance. Antibodies against all above mentioned pathogens were detected but mostly animals were already antibody-positive at re-stocking. We demonstrated that supply air filtration as well as recirculating air filtration technique can easily be implemented in an already existing ventilation system and that recirculating air filtration resulted in enhanced lung health compared to supply air-filtered and non-filtered barns. A more prominent effect might have been obtained in a breeding facility because of the longer life span of sows and a higher biosecurity level with air filtration as an add-on measure.

AB  - Airborne contaminants produced by industrial agricultural facilities contain chemical and biological compounds that can impact the health of residents living in close proximity. Settled dust can be a reservoir for these contaminants and can influence long-term exposures. In this study, we sampled the indoor- and outdoor-settled dust from 40 homes that varied in proximity to industrial-scale dairies (ISD; industrial-scale dairy, a term used in this paper to describe a large dairy farm and adjacent waste sprayfields, concentrated animal feeding operation or animal feeding operation, that uses industrial processes) in the Yakima Valley, Washington. We analyzed settled dust samples for cow allergen (Bos d2, a cow allergen associated with dander, hair, sweat and urine, it is a member of the lipocalin family of allergens associated with mammals), mouse allergen (Mus m1; major mouse allergen, a mouse urinary allergen, in the lipocalin family), dust mite allergens (Der p1 (Dermatophagoides pteronissinus 1) and Der f1 (Dermatophagoides farinae 1)), and endotoxin (a component of the cell walls of gram negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide, which can be found in air and dust and can produce a strong inflammatory response). A concentration gradient was observed for Bos d2 and endotoxin measured in outdoor-settled dust samples based on proximity to ISD. Indoor-settled dust concentrations of Bos d2 and endotoxin were also highest in proximal homes. While the associated health effects of exposure to cow allergen in settled dust is unknown, endotoxin at concentrations observed in these proximal homes (100 EU/mg) has been associated with increased negative respiratory health effects. These findings document that biological contaminants emitted from ISDs are elevated in indoor- and outdoor-settled dust samples at homes close to these facilities and extend to as much as three miles (4.8 km) away.

AB  - Crops could accumulate trace metals by soil-root transfer and foliar uptake from atmospheric fallout, and an accurate assessment of pollution sources is a prerequisite for preventing heavy metal pollution in agricultural products. In this study, we examined Pb isotope rates to trace the sources of Pb in wheat grain grown in suburbs. Results showed that, even in zones with scarcely any air pollution spots, atmospheric fallout was still a considerable source of Pb accumulation in wheat. The concentration of Pb in wheat grain has poor correlation with that in farm soil. The Pb concentration in wheat grains with dust in bran coat was significantly higher than that in wheat grains, which indicates that Pb may accumulate by foliar uptake. The Pb isotope rate has obvious differences between the soil and atmospheric fallout, and scatter ratio is significantly closer between the wheat grain and atmospheric fallout. Atmospheric fallout is a more significant source of Pb concentration in wheat grains than in soil. As far as we know, this is the first study on the main sources of lead in grain crop (wheat) samples with isotope. This study aims to improve our understanding of the translocation of foliar-absorbed metals to nonexposed parts of plants.

AB  - Ground-level ozone is formed when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react with hydroxyl radicals and nitrogen oxides in the presence of ultraviolet light. Research has typically focused on the release and control of VOCs from hydrocarbon processing; however, agricultural activities, such as poultry production, can also be VOC sources and potentially contribute to ozone pollution. Therefore, this study examines the emission of C2-C6 VOCs from poultry houses and the use of a vegetative environmental buffer (VEB) as a potential mitigation strategy. Sampling campaigns were conducted at two farms, one with and one without a VEB. Of the nine compounds measured, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were the primary VOCs emitted and had the largest ozone-formation potential (OFP). A significantly larger decrease in the OFP for methanol as a function of distance from the poultry house was observed at the farm with the VEB as compared with at the farm without the VEB. These results suggest that besides being a visual barrier and particulate screen, VEBs can provide some control of VOCs emitted from poultry production.

AB  - Environmental indicators are powerful tools for tracking environmental changes, measuring environmental performance, and informing policymakers. Many diverse environmental indicators, including agricultural environmental indicators, are currently in use or being developed. This special collection of technical papers expands on the peer-reviewed literature on environmental indicators and their application to important current issues in the following areas: (i) model-derived indicators to indicate phosphorus losses from arable land to surface runoff and subsurface drainage, (ii) glutathione-ascorbate cycle-related antioxidants as early-warning bioindicators of polybrominated diphenyl ether toxicity in mangroves, and (iii) assessing the effectiveness of using organic matrix biobeds to limit herbicide dissipation from agricultural fields, thereby controlling on-farm point-source pollution. This introductory review also provides an overview of environmental indicators, mainly for agriculture, with examples related to the quality of the agricultural soil-water-air continuum and the application of model-derived indicators. Current knowledge gaps and future lines of investigation are also discussed. It appears that environmental indicators, particularly those for agriculture, work efficiently at the field, catchment, and local scales and serve as valuable metrics of system functioning and response; however, these indicators need to be refined or further developed to comprehensively meet community expectations in terms of providing a consistent picture of relevant issues and/or allowing comparisons to be made nationally or internationally.

AB  - To comprehensively assess conventional vs. some alternative laying-hen housing systems under U.S. production conditions, a multi-institute and multi-disciplinary project, known as the Coalition for Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES) study, was carried out at a commercial egg production farm in the Midwestern United States over two single-cycle production flocks. The housing systems studied include a conventional cage house (200,000 hen capacity), an aviary house (50,000 hen capacity), and an enriched colony house (50,000 hen capacity). As an integral part of the CSES project, continual environmental monitoring over a 27-month period described in this paper quantifies indoor gaseous and particulate matter concentrations, thermal environment, and building ventilation rate of each house. Results showed that similar indoor thermal environments in all three houses were maintained through ventilation management and environmental control. Gaseous and particulate matter concentrations of the enriched colony house were comparable with those of the conventional cage house. In comparison, the aviary house had poorer indoor air quality, especially in wintertime, resulting from the presence of floor litter (higher ammonia levels) and hens' activities (higher particulate matter levels) in it. Specifically, daily mean indoor ammonia concentrations had the 95% confidence interval values of 3.8 to 4.2 (overall mean of 4.0) ppm for the conventional cage house; 6.2 to 7.2 (overall mean of 6.7) ppm for the aviary house; and 2.7 to 3.0 (overall mean of 2.8) ppm for the enriched colony house. The 95% confidence interval (overall mean) values of daily mean indoor carbon dioxide concentrations were 1997 to 2170 (2083) ppm for the conventional cage house, 2367 to 2582 (2475) ppm for the aviary house, and 2124 to 2309 (2216) ppm for the enriched colony house. Daily mean indoor methane concentrations were similar for all three houses, with 95% confidence interval values of 11.1 to 11.9 (overall mean of 11.5) ppm. The 95% confidence interval values (overall mean) of daily mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, in mg/m3, were, respectively, 0.57 to 0.61 (0.59) and 0.033 to 0.037 (0.035) for the conventional cage house, 3.61 to 4.29 (3.95) and 0.374 to 0.446 (0.410) for the aviary house, and 0.42 to 0.46 (0.44) and 0.054 to 0.059 (0.056) for the enriched colony house. Investigation of mitigation practices to improve indoor air quality of the litter-floor aviary housing system is warranted. © The Author 2015.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain tumours (BT) are one of the most frequent tumour types in young people, although little is known about their risk factors.; OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current work was to review and summarize the scientific literature concerning exposure to environmental factors and BT risk in young people (<25 years old).; METHODS: PUBMED, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, IME-Biomedina (bibliographic database of Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas) and Web of science databases were searched. A score to assess the quality of the methodological information was created.; RESULTS: Some possible associations between BT risk in young people were reported for cadmium, consumption of well water, presence of nitrate or nitrate-nitrogen in tap water, mother's passive smoking, air pollution, parental handling of pesticides at home and/or professional pesticide treatment within houses, living on a farm and/or with farm animals, some parental occupations and high amount of meat consumption.; CONCLUSIONS: Although many of the studies reviewed suggest associations between the environmental exposures and BT in children and young adults, at present no reliable conclusion can be drawn as most results are based on small number of cases and exposure assessment is limited. Large-scale studies with better exposure assessment are needed to shed light on these possible associations, especially on exposure to heavy metals, tab water consumption, pesticides and parental smoking. © 2019 S.
